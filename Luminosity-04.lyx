\begin_layout Chapter
Matchmaking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward gave me a vaguely meaningful look, catching my eye as I left the
 biology room to go to gym.
 I wasn't sure what the meaning was supposed to be -- perhaps if it was
 important he'd find me after school.
 As Mike and I walked towards our final class, it looked like his brain
 was chewing on itself -- I didn't envy him a bit -- but he still didn't
 say anything.
 I decided that it was a priority to politely deflect him.
 I wasn't actually sure how reliable the vampires were about not eating
 people, especially since Alice had been worried, and goodness only knew
 how Edward would react to whatever he caught of ongoing teenage boy thoughts
 from Mike about a mutual crush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe I could set Mike up with someone else.
 If he liked me, that was some clue about his type -- slender but without
 any visible athleticism, brown-haired, brown-eyed, symmetrical-ish but
 not particularly striking, that was me.
 I thought about the girls who sat with the group at lunch.
 Jessica seemed plausible; she was dark like me, little and cute and fairly
 popular.
 I didn't see them settling down and having five kids, but it wasn't hard
 to picture them going to watch a movie.
 I'd try to suggest him to her discreetly while we studied trig.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eric was less obvious.
 While I started my yoga, I paired him in my head with others.
 There was Angela, but she'd made vague murmurs about liking some unidentified
 boy, and I didn't think from how she described him that it was anyone I'd
 met (even after I corrected for the fact that he was being described by
 a girl who liked him).
 I supposed Lauren might work, although I wasn't sure Eric deserved her
 -- he was fairly nice, and Lauren was the least pleasant individual I'd
 yet encountered in Forks unless I made very broad inferences from what
 I'd seen of Rosalie.
 But she 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 pretty -- had a sort of haughty class to her bearing and well-proportioned
 features.
 Her coloring wasn't like mine, at the moment, but she dyed her hair different
 colors from time to time and with any luck I could time my attempt for
 a week when she went dark.
 I wasn't sure if she'd have him, but she complained enough about being
 single.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt a little guilty about planning all this matchmaking more for my convenien
ce than for the happiness of its objects.
 Upon noticing this guilt, I also noted that my brain was trying to rearrange
 its estimations of the couple quality to justify it: 
\emph on
Jessica and Mike would be cute together
\emph default
, said my brain, 
\emph on
it's not like they couldn't work out, they're already friends, aren't they?
 Jessica didn't mention him in her list of top ten boys she wouldn't touch
 with a ten foot pole\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 And maybe Lauren is only girl-mean, and would be nice
 to a boy like Eric\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I entered my next pose too fast, yanked something in my leg that wasn't
 meant to be yanked, and promptly moved to a more comfortable sitting posture
 to massage the discomfort away.
 Mike jogged over after perfunctorily soliciting teacher permission.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Are you okay, Bella?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing broken, nothing dislocated, just an unhappy leg.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

If you could tell the teacher I'm going to just sit for the rest of class,
 that would be great,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told him, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but I don't think I need medical help -- it'll be okay by the bell.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mike nodded obediently and trotted off.
 He reminded me a little of a golden retriever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
He'll only be less happy if you let him simmer in his crush like this,
\emph default
 said my brain.
 
\emph on
It's in his own best interest for you to send him away, and as long as he
 hasn't said anything yet, it would only be needlessly hurtful to address
 it directly.
 Set him up with Jessica for his own good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shook my head to myself, just a little, to put my next thought out into
 the world where it couldn't reshape itself like fog.
 (Taking out a notebook during gym might have made the teacher suspicious
 about my leg.) That wasn't why I wanted to put Jessica and Mike together.
 Even if it was true, it wasn't why I wanted to do it.
 Even if it contributed, and made me want to do it more than I would have,
 it wasn't necessary or sufficient.
 I had no doubt that if I'd wanted Mike for myself, I'd never have dreamed
 about sending Jessica after him because they'd be cute.
 I was sure that if Mike hadn't liked me, but had instead been pining after
 someone else implausible like Rosalie, I wouldn't have bothered with juggling
 his love life to make sure he wasn't marinating in unrequited attraction.
 I just didn't want his attention, and so I was trying to send it somewhere
 else.
 I refused to lie to myself about the nobility of the decision, even as
 it firmed up on my list of plans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What sort of person am I?
\emph default
 It didn't matter if I could make up flattering reasons for my choices.
 They had to be the 
\emph on
actual
\emph default
 reasons I made those choices, or they simply 
\emph on
didn't answer that question
\emph default
.
 If I'd let myself believe the pretty justifications for it all, went along
 with the self-aggrandizing delusion, I'd be mistaken about the one topic
 I most adamantly refused to be mistaken about:

Edward caught up with me on my way to my truck.
 I limped only a little, and he didn't comment on it -- I speculated that
 he'd seen the event through Mike's eyes and didn't want to let any evidence
 of that slip.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jessica's forgotten that she's supposed to call you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he told me.
 That put a ding in my speculation.
 Maybe he'd seen the event and noticed that I didn't want help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess I'd better call her, then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Trig is so important for later life.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward chuckled, then grew more serious.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why did you switch lab partners?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked softly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because the one I was assigned looked at me like I'd recently killed his
 puppy, and then wasn't even in school the next day while I was still getting
 used to things, and Angela and her previous lab partner didn't mind the
 switch,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm very sorry I looked at you that way,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said sincerely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't understand why your wanting to have me for dessert would make you
 look

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Help me figure that one out?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He grimaced -- he seemed to do that a lot, and it didn't do much to help
 his attractiveness, not that he needed help there.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was angry that you were\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 straining my control.
 That you were making me less the person I try to be.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The kind of person who doesn't poke straws into people during school.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right.
 No straws.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He laughed ruefully.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It didn't make any sense to blame you.
 You didn't do anything.
 But it felt like you did.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That explains the anger.
 But before that you were looking at me weirdly too -- like I was confusing.
 What was up with that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'd reached my car by this point, and Edward looked pleased -- maybe that
 I'd asked another question instead of hopping right in and rumbling away?
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The fact that I can't read your mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's never happened before -- that I noticed.
 It actually did take me a while to pick up on it with you, simply because
 I wasn't trying until I noticed that everyone in school was thinking about
 you.
 I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, and\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 couldn't tell.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't sure if Alice had told Edward -- or thought near Edward -- that
 she'd told me that he liked me.
 I elected not to bring it up on this occasion.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess mindreading is something you get used to after a while?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I couldn't do it, before,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Carlisle realized what was going on before I did; I kept replying to his
 thoughts as though he'd spoken them aloud.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why do some of you have extra powers and some not?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We aren't entirely sure.
 In my case and Jasper's, at least -- we can only guess about Alice -- it's
 similar to strengths we had as humans.
 I was very good at reading people.
 Ironically, now that I have my abilities to rely on, I think I've deteriorated
 at reading faces,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said wryly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jasper was a leader, very charismatic -- he could calm a crowd or rile them
 up even before he turned.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm having a little trouble guessing what would produce Alice's ability,
 if your trend isn't just a coincidence.
 Good pattern recognition? Extensive physics knowledge?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know.
 At any rate, just because Jasper and Alice and I are the flashiest talents
 doesn't mean the others don't have unique abilities.
 Rosalie kept her beauty.
 Emmett's the strongest.
 Carlisle has an amazing ability to resist blood -- he can practice as a
 physician without a trace of discomfort.
 Esme brought with her the ability to love passionately.

When I'm a vampire, will I be able to turn invisible?

 I suggested.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Since I'm mentally invisible now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward growled a little in the back of his throat.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't have to be a vampire,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice's visions are

 There has to be a way for you to stay human.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Two things,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

First, there doesn't have to be such a way.
 The universe is 
\emph on
allowed
\emph default
 to be the way it is, even if the way it is, is a way that winds up with
 me being a vampire.
 Second, I kind of like the idea.
 I'm not sure when a good time will be, but it sure sounds like it comes
 with a

I started at him incredulously, and he cut off mid-sentence.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What? Okay, Alice said that the three day initiation process or whatever
 it is is ânot funâ.
 I could buy that it is sufficiently not fun that you wish it hadn't happened
 to you, don't think it was worth it.
 It'd be a little hard to believe, but not impossible.
 But why in the world would you want to go 
\emph on

 that part? I don't know how old the rest of you are, but you realize Alice

 said Edward coaxingly.
 I supposed he wanted me to stay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nope,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't want to have cryptic conversations.
 If that's the only kind you can have right now, I'm going to go home and
 call Jessica.
 See you tomorrow!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 I hoped I'd managed to inject enough cheer into my voice that I didn't
 sound vengeful.
 That wasn't the point; I didn't want to get back at Edward for being mysterious
, I just didn't want to put up with the mystery because it was unpleasant.
 It would be nice if eventually he decided to stop being vague and unhelpful
 around me, but even if he didn't, I would still get more of what I wanted
 by leaving when his remarks took a turn for the uninformative.

\begin_layout Standard
Edward didn't try to follow my truck.
 I parked in the driveway, let myself into the house, and phoned Jessica.
 She admitted that the plans had completely slipped her mind, but agreed
 that I should come over after dinner to study.
 I whipped up a sauce and started marinating the night's salmon in it.
 Fish cooked fast enough that it made more sense to start it after Charlie
 got home.
 I set a timer to remind myself to preheat the oven sufficiently far in
 advance, then did my homework for the day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I'd finished that, I took out my notebook and preserved my important
 insights for the day, notably the bit where I wasn't noble or generous
 for trying to set up my friends with each other.
 My timer rang while I was in the middle of wondering why Edward wouldn't
 want me to be a vampire.
 There wasn't an obvious motive.
 If he liked me, he ought to want me around; even if he thought he'd get
 sick of me, it wasn't a given that I had to stick with the Cullens for
 the rest of my eternal life.
 If I was turned, as an added bonus, I would no longer smell like food and
 he wouldn't have to constantly fight temptation in order to have me nearby
 safely.
 Perhaps there were some consequences to sanity that Alice hadn't mentioned,
 which I hadn't picked up on yet.
 (Although in retrospect I thought I had adequate explanations for their
 behavior, it didn't escape me that I'd considered Alice and Edward to be
 possibly crazy.) It did seem unlikely on the face of it that three solid
 days of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not fun
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or a sudden inability to recharge with sleep, would have 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 ill effects.
 I'd have to inquire a little more carefully.
 But I shut my notebook and went to turn the oven on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Charlie's timing was good: he arrived just as the beep indicating correct
 fish-baking temperature sounded.
 I put tinfoil on a baking sheet and fish on the tinfoil and the entire
 thing in the oven while asking him about his day.
 Forks did not have much in the way of crime.
 Charlie mostly caught speeders, and the occasional out-of-towner hiking
 buff who thought it'd be fun to cause trouble while away from home.
 Accordingly, his day had been uneventful.
 When he was done describing it in all its uneventfulness, I told him that
 I'd sat with the Cullens and Hales at lunch -- he seemed happy about that.
 The ritual exchange of daily activity information complete, I started to
 sautÃ© spinach; it went fast, and I wanted to time it to finish when the
 salmon did.
 Charlie turned on the 
\noun on
tv
\noun default
 to watch a few minutes of some sporting event until the oven timer rang.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After we'd finished eating, I called Jessica again to let her know I was
 on my way and confirm the best route to her address.
 It was only five minutes away, in the next neighborhood over.
 We studied, and after we'd reviewed most of the material, I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Jessica, thanks so much for helping me with this.
 Math's my worst subject apart from gym.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The compliments sounded weird in my head.
 But I knew that was only a fact about my head.
 Compliments did not sound weird to the people who received them unless
 they already suspected ulterior motives.
 At any rate, I wasn't lying.
 Whatever Edward said, Jessica had reached out to me and provided very valuable
 companionship -- and trig help.

 Now that Jessica had gone and identified

voice

 Jessica didn't ask Mike out, but she did sit next to him and keep up a

Angela asked me if I'd seen the rainbow earlier.
 I had.
 I was starting to think that the demos of the vampires' powers planned
 for after school were pointless; I already had an awfully strong expectation
 that they'd be exactly as Alice had described them, and so I didn't anticipate
 that the tests would 
\emph on
teach
\emph default
 me anything the way tests ought.
 It almost reminded me of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

experiments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 science classes did -- the book would tell you a procedure to follow, and
 if you got a different result than the book said, what that meant was 
\emph on
you set it up wrong
\emph default
, not that you'd learned something revolutionary about physics or whatever.
 I actually 
\emph on
liked
\emph default
 science, but not repetition -- the things they gave students didn't even
 approach the possibility of surprise afforded official replication studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What I 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 looking forward to was getting to the edge of what the vampires knew about
 themselves, and joining them in learning more fine details.
 Maybe they had a combined age of many centuries, but there was a vast hypothesi
s-space, and I didn't have reason to guess that any of them had unusually
 experimental dispositions.
 For example, I would have been willing to bet money that they'd never checked
 whether Edward's range was affected by magnets or whether Alice could be
 thrown off by someone who kept being distracted while trying to make a
 decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wondered, briefly, if Jasper's power would work on me even if he tried
 it.
 I was uncommonly good at moderating my own emotions.
 If he tried to calm me when I 
\emph on
chose
\emph default
 to be angry -- or, more likely given the circumstances such a trial would
 take place in, when I chose to be 
\emph on
really creeped out
\emph default
 -- how well would it function? If he really only affected non-mental things,
 I might be just as susceptible as anyone.
 But I was skeptical that purely physical intervention could exert as much
 fine control as the vampires had hinted he had.
 Also, I had the impression that his power worked on vampires too.
 They didn't have heartbeats to change -- what 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 he messing with, when he adjusted vampire moods?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why couldn't Edward read me? How far ahead could Alice see? In what ways,
 if any, were her visions useful even when they depicted futures that wouldn't
 be? What powers would 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 have as a vampire? Did vampires ever have duplicate special powers? What
 others were there in the world? Did their standard-issue abilities like
 strength and speed vary much? (Edward had said Emmett was the strongest
 of the family, but not by how much or how common variations like that were.)
 How did eating humans as opposed to not affect their psychology, their
 physiology, their powers? How did turning work? Why did their eyes change
 color? What made them all so pretty? How did they manage to be flexible
 without shedding rock dust everywhere, with their skin the way it was?
 Did their hair grow? What were the social customs of vampires in general,
 and how did the family I knew differ? How had the Volturi come to be in
 charge and who worked with them? Why would humans smell more appealing
 than other species -- what was it about our blood?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was so much to 
\emph on
wonder
\emph default
 about.
 Sitting in Biology instead of racing out with a truckload of notebooks
 and investigating vampires for a sleepless week straight was like forcing
 myself not to scratch a terrible itch when I had perfectly good fingernails.
 I took the risk of pulling out the notebook I had on me and writing down
 my questions, which helped a little; at least none of them would get lost,
 and when I had the chance, I could follow up on them.
 Angela didn't seem curious, but Edward must have heard my pencil scratching
 and been able to tell it was me, because he swiveled around to look.
 He took in the picture of me and my notebook in a swift glance, then turned
 around again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Biology came to a merciful end.
 I tried not to think of more questions about vampires during gym, given
 the increased suspiciousness and physical awkwardness of notebook use from
 Child Pose.
 I was partially successful: I dreamed up only variations and extrapolations
 of the questions I'd already written down, which I expected to reconstruct
 when I next looked at my notes even if they slipped my mind first.
 When gym ended, I paused to scribble down useful keywords like

What do you write in your notebooks?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

Hmm,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go ahead, if you like,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, shrugging.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I want not to tell you about my notebooks more than I want to talk to you.
 I'm going to see you again in like an hour for the are-you-guys-kidding-me

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't seem to like this answer, so I continued, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Besides, I didn't say, âHey, Edward, you should make a decision based on
 something I wrote in my notebook,â and then refuse to tell you what I'd
 written.
 Whereas you apparently think I should find something about Rosalie informative
 to what I choose to do with my life, but won't tell me what it is -- and
 you 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 justify this with something like Rosalie preferring you not share her personal
 information with me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She probably would,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then you shouldn't tell me her personal information.
 It might even be why you 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 tell me, for all I know.
 But you didn't say so then.
 And if you knew you weren't going to tell me, there was no reason to bring
 it up.
 There might have been a reason to talk to Rosalie, and ask 
\emph on
her
\emph default
 to talk to me, or for permission to tell me yourself.
 But no reason to mention that the information 
\emph on
exists
\emph default
 if you won't give it to me and aren't even sure I can get it from the right
 source.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked a little nonplussed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't know how long to expect to be doing science to you guys, so I want
 to get home and make sure my dad will come home to a sandwich.
 I suppose if you want to you could join me, since we're headed to the same
 place later.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I shrugged again.
 I was trying to look nonchalant, but I was starting to be a bit uncomfortable
 with the fact that Edward had a crush on me.
 It would be so 
\emph on
complicated
\emph default
, at least until I was a vampire.
 In no small part, this was because he craved my blood: he could apparently
 keep the craving under control in normal social circumstances, but I didn't
 know how his restraint would hold up with significant physical contact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if -- after I did a lot more thinking -- I decided I wasn't interested,
 I wasn't sure if I would be able to get rid of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He got into the passenger seat while I tried to conceal the alarm this notion
 yielded.
 I pulled out of the parking lot and onto the highway, trying to postpone
 further consideration until I wasn't in control of a moving vehicle.
 It would be much safer to wonder if I was free to make a choice while holding
 a jar of mustard instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did not get us -- well, myself -- killed on the way to my house.
 Edward complained about my obedience to the speed limit; I didn't talk.
 He followed me into my house and took a chair while I busied myself with
 sandwich ingredients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had no ability whatsoever to act in self-defense if Edward, or any vampire,
 decided physical confrontation was in order.
 It would be a less even fight than me versus a housefly: those things were
 hard to catch.
 The vampires were all so much faster than me that I'd be about as hard
 to hit as the side of a barn.
 This would be true even if I were not the reigning champion of the World
 Clumsiness Cup.
 It did not only apply to situations in which a vampire decided to kill
 me: I was just as vulnerable to any scenario in which one decided to restrict
 my movement, injure me, take my belongings, or otherwise help him or herself
 to anything whatever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assembling Charlie's sandwich was calming, and I started making a second
 one when I was done with the first, half for that reason and half because
 I knew he could probably eat two.
 With a slightly cleared head, I reasoned to myself that I was actually
 in more or less this position with most humans, too.
 I 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 World Clumsiness Champ, not particularly strong, or fast, or able to walk
 across flat and stable surfaces.
 I did not have any reason to expect to walk away triumphant if, say, Mike
 or Eric decided that they wanted to fight me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I started making a third sandwich, to wrap up and take with me for dinner,
 on the assumption that the vampires wouldn't have any normal food.
 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 was vampire food.
 If a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

regular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vampire saw me hanging out with Edward, they'd assume he wanted his supper
 kept warm for later and that was the only reason I had a pulse.
 And this fact made Edward more dangerous than Mike or Eric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other facts that made Edward more dangerous were his unaccountability, his
 undeflectability, and -- ironically -- the fact that I wasn't sure I 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 want him back.
 He was unaccountable because, if something went pear-shaped and I went
 home, telling Charlie would accomplish nothing: my father was as vulnerable
 as I -- this wasn't true of any human, at least not predictably.
 He was undeflectable because he could read minds: if I'd tried to send
 Jessica after him (ignoring for thought experiment purposes that I was
 pretty sure she'd tried herself and been turned away) he'd see that in
 her thoughts as soon as she made her first insinuation, and realize what
 was going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And because I couldn't say for sure that I wasn't interested and wanted
 him gone, I didn't 
\emph on
want
\emph default
 to do something drastic like skip town in the middle of the night and move
 to Thailand.
 That might protect me from all the nasty dangers associated with being
 a vampire's object of affection; I suspected it would at least make me
 
\emph on
hard
\emph default
 to follow, albeit perhaps not impossible with enough money and magic.
 It might make me not worth pursuit, if I did a good enough job of it.
 But I couldn't avoid those dangers while keeping the perks.

I'm not entirely perfect about only having emotions that make sense,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Anyway, I

prefer
\emph default
 not to travel at a hundred and fifty miles an hour in a car whether it
 is actually dangerous to me or not.
 I prefer not to do things that would scandalize Charlie; I prefer not to
 do things that would make onlookers believe themselves to be in danger;
 and I kind of like the scenery around here.
 The fact that I would be terrified to travel at a hundred and fifty miles
 an hour makes me more effective at arranging not to so travel by automatically
 reminding me to slow down if the speedometer drifts too far right, which
 means that keeping the fear makes me better at getting what I want.

 RenÃ©e was always insistent that compliments were gifts to be accepted and
 that it was rude to turn them down, however silly they were; I agreed and
 made a consistent effort to put the theory into practice.
 I'd gotten over the fact that I had a lot in common with my parents when
 I was fifteen.
 There were well-established and robust mechanisms ensuring that I'd resemble
 them, and when I wasn't in the middle of a fit of teenage angst, I loved
 my parents and knew there were lots of worse people to take after in the
 world.
 This didn't mean I didn't work on excising their worse qualities -- RenÃ©e
 had a flightiness that I consciously opposed in myself, for example, although
 I had so little trouble doing so that I thought perhaps I just took after
 Charlie in that department.
 (He was a steady, responsible sort.)

 There was another silence.
 I wondered if it was challenging to talk to Edward just because I knew
 that he liked me and he didn't know that I knew (I thought).
 It was good for other reasons that he hadn't spit it out, though, for the
 same reason that it was good that Mike and Eric were silent on their analogous
 issues; it gave me more time to think.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was too 
\emph on
gorgeous
\emph default
.
 That was the word Jessica had chosen when I'd first asked her about the
 Cullens, and that was precisely the right one, although it had many equally
 serviceable relatives such as 
\emph on
beautiful
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
yummy
\emph default
.
 I'd noticed that much even back when I thought he hated me; it would have
 been hard to miss.
 He had a voice to match.
 I'd only be deluding myself if I tried to pretend that it didn't make my
 eyebrows jump a little when I'd noticed he was rich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, yes, shallowness ahoy, but it mattered more to be 
\emph on
correct
\emph default
 than to pretend myself deep.
 If I tried to convince myself that I found Edward interesting for 
\emph on
deep
\emph default
 reasons, it would lead down a path of feedback loops and foolish reasoning
 that 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 literally kill me.
 I would be more likely to take stupid risks with Edward if I fancied myself
 up to my eyebrows in transcendent romantic adoration.
 I would be less likely to behave like an idiot around him if I recognized
 that he was a hot (well, cold), rich guy who sounded like an angel and
 had sexy superpowers and that these things were not irrelevant to me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking a step back from all of these admittedly relevant facts, I turned
 to more practical thoughts: none of the qualities on that list were unique
 to Edward.
 The combination wasn't unique to Edward.
 The combination wasn't even unique to Edward 
\emph on
among people I knew
\emph default
, although his brothers were both taken and neither similarly approximated
 what I considered my

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 except for the fact that I'd never dated.
 Edward was not the only person interested in me, even as of the previous
 week and a half.
 If he had other, rarer personal traits that would also appeal to me, I
 didn't know about them yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, there was simply no call to rush anything.
 We were both going to live forever.
 And once I was a vampire, too, I'd be better able to separate the part
 where maybe I wanted Edward from the part where maybe I didn't have any
 other choice.

 Edward was looking at me sadly, hurt by my mistrust.

I frowned to myself, retrieved Alice's weather predictions from my pocket,
 and confirmed that it was misting just like she'd said to expect for this
 thirty-four minute period of Thursday afternoon.
 I folded up the paper again and put it away.

Is there anything else I can do to help you feel safe?

 he asked.

This was a fair question.
 And the obvious answer, 
\emph on
don't eat me
\emph default
, was silly: if he ate me, I would not be afraid anymore.

Let me think,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I requested, and he nodded.

I thought.
 Edward already knew about the notebooks, so I supposed I could write without
 giving up information I wanted to keep to myself, but decided against it.
 First, it would be a poor choice to needlessly tease him with the fact
 that the notebooks were for my eyes only.
 Second, I'd heard of a trick where even a human could guess what was being
 written: one gave someone a big squeaky marker, looked away, and told them
 to write a number from one to ten, and listened for duration and number
 of strokes of the pen.
 It was a lot better than chance, and I guessed that vampire hearing could
 probably distinguish all the letters of the alphabet if the vampire in
 question cared to try.
 One trait I did not ascribe to Edward was the tendency to scrupulously
 avoid picking up on information that was available to him.

How often do humans smell extra tasty to vampires in general?

Not often.
 You're the only one, for me -- I've been a vampire since 1918,

 he supplied as I opened my mouth to ask.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Emmett says it's\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 happened\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 to him twice, since turning in 1935.
 One stronger than the other.
 No one else I know.
 But,

 he added reluctantly,

neither of Emmett's were as strong as you.

Did Emmett eat his two?

 I asked baldly, and Edward nodded slightly, frowning and not looking at
 me.

\end_inset

And have you, Edward, personally ever eaten a human?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I was actually not sure what the answer to this would be.
 If Emmett belonged to the family and had eaten at least two people, Edward
 could too; clearly they did not eject relatives for small lapses like murder.
