Helper

\begin_layout Standard
The darkness pervaded everything.
 I couldn't feel my limbs, I couldn't tell if I was breathing, I didn't
 know if my eyes were open.
 No pain, no comfort, no warmth, no cold, no up or down, no plain taste
 of nothing in my mouth, or even the buzz of my own heartbeat.
 Nothing at all.

I wondered how long it would take me to go insane.

Alec,
\emph default
 I guessed, but while it seemed likely that this was what it felt like (didn't
 feel like, rather) to be under his blanket of sensory deprivation, I didn't
 know why he'd be doing it to me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unless somehow -- presumably without Addy's help -- the Volturi were aware
 of my tinkering with Chelsea's work (I felt a moment of profound stupidity
 for not trying to get Addy's help directly with that -- hadn't Chelsea
 been looking at me suspiciously for long enough that I ought to have asked?
 Wouldn't it be in Addy's interests, at least as she stated them, for Chelsea's
 suspicions to never get to the point of action as long as I wasn't trying
 to escape?) and had decided to kill me.

My power gave no feedback.
 If it was working I couldn't tell.
 We'd never worked on how to target people I couldn't see -- in fact, I
 didn't even know how I decided to send to someone I wasn't touching; I
 hadn't thought about it at all.
 I could be accidentally calling for help to Sulpicia, or some random human
 in Volterra, or someone else similarly unlikely to benefit me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I decided it would be safer to keep trying -- to assume that everything
 I tried failed and then think of what the next thing to do would be.
 If shouting for Jake 
\emph on
hadn't

 worked, what would be the next plan? Images were easier, I'd been doing

images
\emph default
 since I was a

 Memories were easier than made-up pictures.
 I screamed a visual of myself, the most distressed expression I'd ever
 seen on my own face in a mirror, and then did it again, and again, ignoring
 the building tiredness.

\begin_layout Standard
Fragments of memories competed for my attention, displacing each other in
 random sequence.
 I heard familiar voices and strangers, recalled places I recognized from
 my travels and ones I'd never seen in my life, watched thoughts march past
 in a hundred languages that had all acquired eerie familiarity, saw arbitrary
 snatches of life histories play out in vampire clarity and human blur.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was almost a day before I was lucid enough, and had gotten sufficiently
 accustomed to processing the memories, that I could shove them aside and
 look at my surroundings in the present.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later, I asked Addy what happened, and she showed me:

Vastly diminished efficacy,

 I report.

Only a few seconds of the thoughts were new, of course -- this will, I expect,
 be a matter of delay between uses rather than a simple situation where
 it's only effective against a given target once.

\emph default
 It hadn't been disorienting at all to touch Aro, even the first time, and
 receive a much larger payload of memory; but that was a benefit of 
\emph on
his
\emph default
 power.
 Very convenient, how he can store memories so neatly, even pruning redundancies
 when he reads a person for the second time, without his being consciously
 disturbed by any items he doesn't choose to examine.
 It's a wonderful power -- and completely 
\emph on
still
\emph default
, doing only the exact same thing at all times; however he may flutter about
 envying Edward's range, he didn't work on his talent when it counted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His power is a little like mine, actually.
 Both of us automatically helping ourselves to something of those we touch.
 Both living mostly vicariously.
 And to be honest, my 
\emph on
native
\emph default
 power hasn't changed since I turned and acquired it in magical form in
 the first place, but given what I can do, that's a technicality; there's
 a witch born every minute and one turned every month or so.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I have a chance to discourse further on the nature of witchcraft
 with my pupil, though, the dead, dark blankness of Alec's power creeps
 over me and I have other things occupying my attention.

\begin_layout Standard
Aro 
\emph on
daren't

 He might have considered it before; in fact, I'm sure he has.
 But I've given Elspeth

 I can advertise what he'd rather have kept between us to anyone nearby,
 even through Alec!

The child is shouting for her wolf.
 By the current taste of her power, she 
\emph on
can

 aim for him without seeing him, although I doubt she has the strength to
 make the signal carry that far.
 But I probably fell on top of her when Alec hit us, and she's still more
 oriented towards touch; I'm getting copies of everything.
 It really is a delicious power, and not as harmless as it first appears.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hm

\begin_layout Standard
One of my questions is answered: Aro 
\emph on
isn't
\emph default
 that stupid.
 
\emph on
Caius
\emph default
 is that 
\emph on
ignorant
\emph default
.
 Dwi's voice chimes in my mind.
 [Caius feels there is reason to mistrust you, and with the witches of your
 collection all assimilated into our coven save one whom Aro can make use
 of more directly, you have lost a considerable portion of your usefulness.
 Do you have anything to say in your defense on either count?] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Damn it all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caius knows nothing; if I tell him, it would certainly do Aro harm, but
 take all my leverage away from me; the anarchy that would result might
 not be any more kindly disposed to me than Caius apparently is.
 Where 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 Aro? Perhaps Dwi will tell me -- [Caius? Did he make this decision alone?]
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Marcus agreed to the plan.] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marcus will say anything to make intrusive people go away and leave him
 to his pining; that's meaningless.
 Aro's out of town, then.
 What would have triggered Caius to act at this most inopportune time, when
 I can't blackmail my way out of it? [May I ask what prompted the choice?
 The witches have been up and about for a week and a half.] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a pause.
 The screaming girl is trying images now.
 Dwi tells me, [Chelsea has been noticing odd disintegration of Elspeth's
 attitudes towards the coven for some time now, but thought nothing of it
 until she spoke to Jane, who had also noticed odd behavior in the girl
 and believes you to be responsible for it.
 They brought the matter to Caius in Aro's absence.
 Do you have anything to say for yourself?] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[I would like the chance to speak to Aro, even if only through you, before
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Caius anticipated that request and has refused it.
 He suspects that you have some sort of unusual hold over Aro, and expects
 that Aro would be glad to have you gone even if he'd argue for your being
 spared given the chance.] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I can't fault Caius's inductive powers.
 That's more or less exactly the case.
 [Why is Aro out of town?] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[A disruptive coven in Nicaragua may have an interesting witch in it, whom
 he might pardon.
 Chelsea is with him.] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The girl has another idea -- 
\emph on
Addy, are you still there?
\begin_inset space ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Dwi, I imagine you don't like me much anymore, but we were friends, once,]
 I say, ignoring the child as a plan forms.
 [I have nothing else to say, but I want to ask you to let me know who's
 going to kill me, and when.
 I won't feel anything and I can't bear the thought of suddenly winking
 out of existence without knowing, Dwi...] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment's pause, and he said, [Saeed is going up with the saw.
 He'll start...
 now.] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in that moment, I slam 
\emph on
everything
\emph default
 into 
\emph on
everyone
\emph default
 the hybrid girl's power will let me touch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alec's cloud of insensibility evaporates and I'm free.
 I'm on my feet in an instant; Saeed is listing limply to one side, and
 the saw clatters out of his hand to the floor, having left only one stinging
 nick under my chin.
 I don't know how long this will last, but I do know I probably didn't get
 everyone in the compound.
 If I'm lucky, I got everyone who knew what was going on.
 Time to make a break for it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a window I can go out by; I can only care so much about the sunshine
 right now, but that's not what makes me hesitate.
 Elspeth, caught when I deployed her own weapon with my greater force, is
 even more insensate than Saeed.
 I'm not

 Or I could blast him with the memories too, but I'm

 than likely, mated vampires I've caught in the push are only so caught
 because their mates aren't in immediate danger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I spin and throw myself out the window, and hear him following.
 I don't need to look behind me.
 He has nowhere to go; he'll follow me as long as I reassure him periodically
 that I'm not planning to hurt his girl.

\begin_layout Standard
I break into and hotwire a parked car, managing to do it without any humans

 or whatever it is that takes up so much of his time; he's gone as often
 as not, and he usually doesn't carry a phone on those excursions.
 For some reason he prefers not to be interrupted while he's away on his
 trips.
 But he'll return eventually and will be sent after us if they have any
 interest in our retrieval.
 I am excellent in a fight, but the feeble imitation of Jane that Elspeth
 has acquired won't let me hold off a team of memory-blast-immunized Volturi
 fighters on my own.
 Even a handful of allied vampires -- witches or not -- would give me a
 chance.

Briefly, I regret not finding Dwi and taking his power before departing.
 It would be handy right about now.
 I could use it to look up minor witch friends from long ago, too inconsequentia

 are and get them to join me.

Edward's power let me keep some tabs on what's going on in Denali.
 The Cullens have been busy collecting friends and allies.
 Last I heard, the Alaskan coven was playing host to not only their cousins,
 but also Zafrina's ordinary sisters Kachiri and Senna, an English friend
 of Carlisle's called Alistair with a minor power, and three powerless American
 nomad singles called Garrett, Mary, and Randall.
 A poor showing, but then, they probably could have gotten better attendance
 if the Volturi and I hadn't gone around snapping up all the best witches
 and their mates

 If I did, I would have abandoned her in the compound; she'll be rather

 Even without Aro's convenient automatic storage and sorting, there is no

 I

I sift through her memories -- is there anyone who might help her, other
 than the doomed rebels in Alaska? Someone with a known address? Hmm.
 The Irish coven is a possibility.
 They don't have a known address, and in fact they range over the whole
 island, but the vegetarian faction -- Maggie and Gianna and Ilario -- might
 have a permanent residence under their real names, if they take after the
 Cullens in that regard.
 I haven't heard of them migrating to Alaska as part of the rebellion, but
 Gianna gave birth to Elspeth and might feel something for her.

The three of them, possibly in addition to Siobhan and Liam, would give
 enough numbers that I and Elspeth's dog could probably defeat or escape
 the size team liable to be sent after us once Demetri returns.
 Four or five people, maybe half a dozen -- sending large groups away makes
 Chelsea nervous and leaves her with too much to do too quickly on their
 return.
 They're unlikely to send wolves.
 It's too easy to use Elspeth as a shield, whom the wolves won't dare touch
 (...

 and anyway I highly doubt that any of the wolves have already been hit

You know, just out of curiosity as to what would happen, one of the guards
 tried feeding a captive witch under Alec's power animal blood once.
 She wouldn't swallow it.
 Apparently you need a fair amount of willpower to manage the diet; it's
 not the sort of thing that will happen by reflex.
 Elspeth might be different in that respect from a vampire, I suppose.
 Or she might be lucid enough to swallow deliberately.
 Or not.

 His company is very tiresome; I don't make any further attempt at conversation.

I sift through my memories, mostly copied ones, to see what I know about
 Ireland and what strategies might work best for tracking down the coven.
 Eventually I recall a fellow with access to enough of the records of the
 Republic of Ireland that he will, if nothing else, be able to narrow my
 search to the island's northern tip if he finds no data on the family I
 seek.
 He is almost certainly still alive; the latest memory I have involving
 him is only eight years old and he was just in his forties at the time.
 It's hard to say whether he'll be cooperative, but that part I can probably
 arrange if necessary.

The wolf gets a total of two hours of sleep, and then I wake him and get

 I manage to avoid killing anyone, this time -- which is good, because a

 and take us to Cork.

 (He has never heard me speak truth, and so the inaccuracy does not stand
 out.) Being a friend of Tom's, apparently, is enough to convince him to
 help me without any need for threats or pressure, beyond the mention of
 Tom's name.
 (Tom is dead, but this fellow doesn't know that or need to.) He has a work
 computer at home and can access the relevant records immediately, and finds
 an address in Wexford to match the names I give him.
 I change cars to make following me harder -- the wolf has to be woken for
 this purpose, but falls back asleep readily -- and head out.
