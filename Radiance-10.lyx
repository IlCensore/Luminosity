\begin_layout Chapter
Doctor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once Jasper was convinced that Alice was really there, he clung to her so
 tightly and so desperately that I wondered if he was sane enough not to
 hurt her, even believing she lived.
 They were murmuring to each other, but I couldn't make out the words, and
 they probably weren't any of my business.
 I kept my distance.
 Charlotte peered at me, curiosity gleaming in black eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you 
\emph on
Elspeth
\emph default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Charlotte asked me, as though she was asking if I was a sasquatch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded.
 Charlotte didn't have Daddy's and Alice's excuse of having been force-fed.
 I'd never met a 
\emph on
friendly
\emph default
 deliberate-person-eating vampire before, only vegetarians and Volturi and
 their prisoners.
 But I wasn't a human, and she wouldn't eat me, and Mama had met friendly
 person-eating vampires before and even gotten one to stop eating people...
 I decided it would be okay to talk to Charlotte.
 And she was 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 a stranger, not someone who 
\emph on
ought
\emph default
 to be family and wouldn't act like it, and that was something I felt like
 I needed in the absence of a real friend.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You must be Charlotte,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded and tiptoed closer to me, not blinking.
 I felt like a museum piece.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Y'know, I wouldn't've believed you were real if Alice 'n Jasper hadn't mentioned
 you 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 he went bonkers and she seemed prob'ly dead,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 She spoke in such a casual drawl that I decided she had to be affecting
 it deliberately.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're nifty.
 Say, there's this one time where Jasper was babbling about seein' Bella
 but then he made up his mind she weren't real, or real but not Bella.
 That really her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He tried to kill her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
What.
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That was Daddy, cold anger taking over his face instantly at the idea that
 Mama's life had been in danger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jasper hissed and backed up, ushering Alice behind his back as though to
 shield her even though she wasn't the one Daddy was mad at.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you try to kill my wife?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daddy demanded, stalking in Jasper's direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She got away!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I exclaimed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He didn't try very 
\emph on
hard
\emph default
, he was completely out of his 
\emph on
mind
\emph default
, she got 
\emph on
away
\emph default
, Daddy!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy didn't approach Jasper any closer, and Jasper didn't try to answer
 the question -- or not out loud, anyway.
 He could be thinking an answer.
 Daddy let out a small hiss and looked to Alice, who was peeking under Jasper's
 arm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We had a deal.
 Where is Bella?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Oh,
\emph default
 I thought, 
\emph on
of course, I'm not 
\emph default
with
\emph on
 Mama, Alice will be able to see her.
 I didn't need to speculate about where she'd go after all.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Looks like...
 Canada, maybe Saskatchewan or something, but I'm guessing from plants,
 there aren't any signs,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice, wrapping her arms around Jasper's waist.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She'll be in Denali in a couple of days if she doesn't stop or change her
 mode of transportation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice paused and wondered aloud, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why is she bald?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daddy's eye twitched.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did she try calling the family?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't see her doing it, so she's not 
\emph on
going
\emph default
 to, but I can't tell you whether she 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 already,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is the reason she's bald something that will make Edward angry? Because
 if so, go right ahead and 
\emph on
don't
\emph default
 mention it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded, clamping down on my thoughts as best I could.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do the Denalis expect her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nope,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're going to be 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 surprised -- barring interference from us, of course.
 Kate's going to try to knock her over as a test -- 
\emph on
it won't work, Edward, calm down
\emph default
.
 I guess we could beat her there, if we take another plane, but I can't...
 think...
 how we got on the first one...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She furrowed her brow.
 I couldn't quite figure out how we'd managed it either.
 The process had been pretty trivial, no 
\emph on
significant
\emph default
 obstacles to anyone noticing us and objecting to our stowing away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I helped,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea, fading in.
 Jasper, Peter, and Charlotte all startled.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will you 
\emph on
stop
\emph default
 fading out when it's not necessary?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 demanded Daddy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That is my state of rest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Allirea replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It requires effort to fade 
\emph on
in
\emph default
.
 I will expend that effort when it is necessary but not otherwise.
 I can get three, perhaps even four of you onto an airplane,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she went on, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but six will be difficult, if these will join us.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She nodded at Peter and Charlotte.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice, can you see Carlisle and Esme?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Daddy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where are they? Is it a house we know the numbers for...? You never looked
 at them while we were

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, I was a little 
\emph on
busy
\emph default
 watching 
\emph on
Jasper
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she snapped.
 She closed her eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, it's a new house.
 Either that or Esme 
\emph on
completely
\emph default
 remodeled the Montana place and knocked down most of the trees outside.
 I think it's a new house.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jasper ruffled her hair fondly and she purred, then went on, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Carlisle's at work.
 Hospital is called...
 aha, they're on Prince Edward Island.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do you see the 
\emph on
hospital's
\emph default
 number written down anywhere?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daddy asked impatiently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We could have him paged -- without getting ahold of him there's no obvious
 way to get plane tickets

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tickets? So these two will join us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Allirea asked, tilting her head.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I agreed to no such thing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Peter, sounding taken aback.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Edward, what are you thinking?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy smirked.
 It was not a nice smile at all.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Volturi have 
\emph on
vastly
\emph default
 overstepped their bounds.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Peter began.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell me, Peter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Daddy scathingly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 do you think kept Alice away from Jasper for more than 
\emph on
five years
\emph default
? I thought Bella was dead; Alice didn't have that problem.
 You don't think she was spending all that time sunning herself on the beach
 without a care in the world?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Daddy explained where he and Alice had been, and Jasper, clutching
 at his mate like she could be perfectly protected if only he held her close
 enough, let a truly awful snarl erupt from his throat, making the air buzz
 with anger.
 I felt a little alien flare of it in myself, and wondered if he was letting
 his empathy push it into the world accidentally.
 Or on purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peter was backing away, and Charlotte trotted to his side, but Jasper twisted
 his head about to look at them.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
I am calling in my favor,
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I, I think we may've more than repaid you these last years,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 volunteered Charlotte, dancing behind her mate.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Peter,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I have,

What favor...?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked blankly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh -- oh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Charlotte helplessly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He -- he let us run away, when I was near done being a newborn, Elspeth.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She gulped.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When he was s'posed to kill me, he let me go with Peter.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't quite follow...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jasper cut in.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was once commonplace, especially in the South, to settle disputes between
 covens by creating armies of newborns.
 I was turned for that reason, and kept on by my creator to manage newer
 vampires because of my gift.
 Peter was one who lasted a bit longer than most; by and large I was obliged
 to destroy the newborns as they came to the end of their strength.
 Peter was helping me with that task one night, but he didn't like it when
 I called Charlotte over, and he told her to run and followed after her.
 I didn't chase them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Our creator wasn't happy with me at all, but I let them go.
 Five years later, they came back for me.
 I left with them, because I was beginning to think my creator would turn
 on me, and Peter 
\emph on
said
\emph default
...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jasper turned to look at Peter.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He said that I had saved their lives, that they owed me, that if I needed
 anything above and beyond the normal support and companionship of a coven
 I was entitled to a favor.
 And I didn't call it in, and then I found Alice and we left to join the
 Cullens, and I still hadn't called it in, and then we came back, and now
 I know what I want, Peter.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peter passed his hand over his eyes and sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Damn you, Jasper, all right.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The hospital's number, please, Alice,

Daddy started to dial the number, then handed the phone to me at the last
 minute.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perhaps you'd better talk to him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It would probably cause a delay if Alice or I had to personally explain
 to him what Chelsea did.
 You're unaffected -- and haven't spent the last several years insane.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I took the phone and finished dialing, though my fingers felt numb.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Souris Hospital,

May I have the phone?

 asked Grandpa's voice, firm but full of gentleness even in his hurry, and
 I imagined he'd heard my name from farther away than he should have let

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can transfer her to your office,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 offered the human, and Grandpa said that would do, and she told me, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

One moment please,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and a moment later he was actually 
\emph on
on
\emph default
 the phone.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked softly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is that really you?

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's really me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 And then words came out of me in a great rush, and every sentence was accompani
ed by the 
\emph on
relief
\emph default
 of the secret's death.
 I had grown up so 
\emph on
smothered
\emph default
 by secrets, even when I was very small and only had to pretend in front
 of neighbors, there were always things to hide or omit or just 
\emph on
lie
\emph default
 about and I hated that, it wasn't 
\emph on
natural
\emph default
, and in spite of everything I could not completely regret the events that
 were letting me 
\emph on
tell tell tell
\emph default
 every bit over and over to everyone I loved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I told Grandpa that Mama had taken me, not some unknown kidnapper.
 I told him how Mama had survived, how we'd lived together in hiding.
 I told him how we'd been separated and how I'd found Jacob's pack and what
 had happened there and about Pera.
 I told him about Cody's departure and our trip to New York and how we'd
 been caught.
 Allirea faded in long enough to let me explain how I'd escaped, how I'd
 found Daddy, and how we'd caught up to Alice and stowed away on a plane
 to Tennessee and found Jasper.
 It was such a long story, and it was so 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 to tell it all; my magic was practically purring with contentment somewhere
 in the back of my mind.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grandpa listened to it all, and asked only the briefest of clarifying questions,
 sounding stunned but capable of handling it.
 I drank in the quiet noises of sympathy he made at the right places, just
 like when he'd been the one to comfort me when I was little and I broke
 one of my toys or got my hair caught in something and cried.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And...
 and I guess that's it, mostly,

 I finished.

Um, we want to find Mama, and Alice says she's on her way to Denali, and
 she doesn't have a phone, and Allirea can't get all of us onto a plane

I'll buy tickets for them, then, and Allirea can get you and your father

 We'll meet you in Denali.
 It...

Yeah,

 I whispered.

Um, Daddy still cares about Alice because she was right there and he could

 And Alice has Jasper.
 But...

I think so,

I heard keys tapping.

I've found you a flight that leaves in three hours.

\begin_layout Standard
Charlotte took her phone out of my hand and concluded the business end of
 the travel plans on behalf of her coven.
 I heard Grandpa politely inquiring after her and Peter's motivations for
 coming along, and she muttered darkly about Jasper and revenge and favors
 and open rebellion.
 Grandpa's reply sounded mostly nonplussed, but he finished buying them
 tickets, and gave her the flight information.
 Charlotte snapped the phone shut.

Allirea went on another spree of theft, and brought back suitcases for the
 people she'd fade and colored contact lenses for those she wouldn't.
 It was really sort of weird to wait for her while she was faded.
 I knew I was waiting for something, and I remembered deciding to wait for
 her, but she didn't seem important enough to justify waiting all by herself,
 so I thought I must have had some other, more significant reason that I
 just couldn't call to mind.
 The others stood around and talked quietly about trivial things, and occasional
ly said something similar: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it that we're waiting for again...? I guess the flight isn't for a
 while yet...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Then Allirea came back and faded in, and I realized how dumb that had been,
 but it didn't stop her from doing it to us all again once we'd gotten into
 our suitcases and she faded out.
 But as before, I let myself be carried along and remembered thinking that
 it was all taken care of.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I fell asleep partway through this flight, too.
 When I woke up, I heard noises that made it sound like we were in the middle
 of changing planes -- beeping vehicles and competing televisions and boarding
 instructions.
 There was an assortment of food in my bag, probably from the airport rather
 than the plane: a sack of donuts and a couple of plastic-wrapped sandwiches
 and three bananas and a bottle of juice.
 I gobbled it all up, hungrier than usual after so long without a proper
 drink of blood and only peanuts the day prior.
 I was pulled onto the new plane, where the captain announced a flight to
 Anchorage.
 Mama had made me memorize a map of Alaska once, in case I ever needed to
 find Denali by myself, and I guessed that it would be our last stop.
 We could have flown on to Fairbanks, but it wasn't all that much closer
 to the park and we'd make better time skipping the last hop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sure enough, my suitcase rolled out of the plane at Anchorage.
 I remembered Allirea existed, got out of my suitcase in the corner she
 deemed unobtrusive, and followed the group out of the airport.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We went through town at a jog, and broke into a flat-out run once we'd cleared
 the population center.
 Eventually Daddy decided we weren't going fast enough, even though Alice
 said we'd be sure to beat Mama by a good half a day at least and he couldn't
 possibly 
\emph on
miss
\emph default
 the Denali vampires, and so he picked me up and we went faster.
 I guessed he just hated moving any slower than he could be moving towards
 the place he'd see her again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wondered why he didn't just ask Alice to send him to meet Mama along her
 route, and Daddy said under his breath, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think she might be annoyed with me if I left you alone with a madman,
 your forcibly estranged aunt, and two lifelong unapologetic non-vegetarians.
 And if I brought you along on an excursion like that, Alice wouldn't be
 able to see where we'd meet her, and you change my speed quite a bit.

\begin_layout Standard

Alice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said, peering over Daddy's shoulder at her where she ran hand-in-hand
 with Jasper, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 see the Denali houses and the family, right? They aren't blanked out? I

It's clear,

Visible, with only the designated people there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Daddy said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The Volturi know you haven't been in contact with the family since your
 mother found you.
 They know I grabbed you, and they could guess I'd strike a deal with Alice,
 but they don't have a reason to expect us to go to ground with family you
 haven't seen in years and we don't care about particularly any more.
 The only reason we 
\emph on

\emph default
 going to see them is Bella.

\begin_layout Standard

That doesn't make sense,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Even if you don't care about them, they still care about you, and you know
 that, and know that you could expect to get help if you asked for it, even
 after explaining.
 Why would you pass that up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

They'd expect Alice to find her mate and stop there, since he was with a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Daddy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're probably extremely confused about me.
 I didn't behave at all as they would have guessed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I remembered Daddy asking Adelaide if she'd kill him, and shuddered in
 his arms.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They may assume I'm in Tennessee for the same reason.
 But when I move up to the top of the priority list, they don't need to

 where I'll go, they can have Demetri lead the way.

I'm not going to go to any trouble to leave him alive,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

If nothing else, he stole my wedding ring.

\begin_layout Standard

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked, bewildered, remembering what I'd heard about his ring.

Mama said she couldn't find it when she found her jewelry -- when I was

\begin_layout Standard

Don't be ridiculous, Elspeth.
 I'm alive, yes, but my ring being missing is hardly a clue.
 Why in the

world
\emph default
, if I had the opportunity to go back for my ring before she went looking,
 would I 
\emph on
leave Bella's jewelry behind
\emph default
? She wanted my ring; didn't it occur to you that I'd have taken hers likewise?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He shook his head.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Demetri took it.
 He picked up Bella's rings too, but Allirea wouldn't have them, so he dropped
 them again.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea snorted.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He thinks it is because I did not want 
\emph on
secondhand
\emph default
 rings, or wanted a ceremony of some kind.
 He will never believe the truth, so I have been frustrating him by pretending
 to have self-contradictory tastes in jewels and festivities.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I wonder if he'd believe me if I just

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perhaps.
 That seems to be something you can do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea neutrally.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I would have settled for that, before.
 Now I want him 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
.
 I would not object if you chose to explain first, so he would know why
 he will die.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Since I'd originally suggested that I serve as a messenger in order to reduce

I decided I was glad to be a member of a species that didn't have permanent

 Mama seemed to have liked the bond.

 But it

 I didn't like the idea of being capable of the agony that had driven Jasper

 the deathwish.
 I didn't like the idea of being so dominated by the perfect fantasy that
 I wouldn't be able to notice a reality like Allirea staring me in the face.

Not when she's faded out,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Daddy.

 Allirea faded out again.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

If she gets called something else.

 Nobody would be likely to call her anything else, except me if I counted,

Mama

 If he was, it was an awfully delayed reaction.

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy clenched his jaw.
 I wasn't sure why.
 That something about her had changed since he last saw her? That I'd dare
 claim to know something like that about her? I'd spent more time with her

 I'd called her more names and she'd said

There was a twitch in his eye.
 I decided not to think things like that while being carried by a possessive

 It wasn't really
