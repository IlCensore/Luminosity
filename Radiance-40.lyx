Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 coughed Jake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, leaning in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Th' other wolf,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, and took a deep, difficult breath.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Quil.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You think that Quil is the wolf who was still in your pack when you phased?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, to confirm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mmhm.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 His eyes closed again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Interesting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Siobhan, interrupting the overcomplicated conversation about travel
 to address this information.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's hard to know if there's more than one remaining packmate...
 but if they had several who hadn't been moved to one of the girls' packs
 yet, I think we could expect them to have been watching for Jake to phase
 in shifts, so he would have noticed a second presence as soon as he phased,
 instead of afterwards.
 It's probably just Quil.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why would they leave just one, instead of two who could trade off on surveillanc
e?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother wondered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe they didn't,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Quil has an imprint.
 If he has some reason to believe Claire is threatened, he could defect
 on his own, just like Brady did on Pera's say-so five years ago.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jake,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured, touching his shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jake, can you remember anything Quil was thinking? I know you were asleep,
 but if there were odd dreams or anything...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Claire,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake whispered, cracking one eye open.
 I felt bad about waking him -- until his healing routed from his system
 the last of the venom I'd failed to remove, and got to work repairing the
 direct damage it had done, he was going to be in significant discomfort
 while awake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't know...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 His eyes fluttered closed again and I let him drop back off, glad that
 he wasn't an insomniac or in too much pain to sleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course Quil was thinking about Claire one way or another,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's his imprint.
 I'd be infinitely more surprised if he managed to think about something
 else.
 What would possibly threaten Claire, though? The Volturi don't have any
 reason to hurt her.
 She's a seven year old girl.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's eight now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Her birthday is the sixth of July...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eight, then
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said my mother, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there's no significant difference.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If she turned up with significant witchcraft they might want to turn her...?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I proposed skeptically.
 I'd seen no hint of any unusual power from Claire when I'd been traveling
 with Jake's pack before our capture.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But not that young, and I'm not sure if Quil would take her away from Volterra
 rather than let them do it anyway.
 Brady didn't kick up that much of a fuss over Pera.
 He didn't like it, but they didn't have to keep him unconscious or anything.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They wouldn't turn her that young -- 
\emph on
unless
\emph default
 it was exceptionally useful withcraft and she were dying,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Like Jane and Alec.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't fit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If Claire were dying, Quil would want her turned rather than 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
, wouldn't he?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 coughed Jake, waking again, and I wondered if we'd better move somewhere
 else so our talking wouldn't disturb him.
 I decided after a moment's thought that he'd probably prefer to have me
 present even if I was going to make noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Really?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked skeptically.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Being a vampire is a fate worse than death according to Quil?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake had worn himself out, and didn't answer; I speculated in his place.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For a little girl, maybe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Especially if she's not 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 dying.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think we're veering a little too far away from the information we actually
 have,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice, can you catch an image of Claire when she's not affected by wolves,
 or does Quil hover too much to allow that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uh, hang on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

I've got a look at her sleeping, alone in her room.
 She looks fine to me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There goes that idea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I suppose there could just be a gap in the schedule, if they have a schedule,
 of who keeps an eye out for Jacob?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Possibly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So there could be two, and Jake phased between when the one went off duty
 and Quil took over...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or Addy found out a way to poach him that we haven't thought of and he's
 trying to get in touch with Jake,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

or something else is going on.
 We don't know, and have no good way to get more data.
 Let's get back to the issue with Pera.
 We don't have a mate for her handy.
 We can't guarantee that Elspeth will be able to deprogram her.
 She has no Genevieve-like relatives lurking in Mexico that the Volturi
 have plausibly overlooked.
 And she could singlehandedly kill us all with the exception of Allirea,
 anybody Allirea shields, and maybe Kate.
 Discuss.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Somebody could e-mail her and offer to bribe her outright,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Doesn't have to be someone known to be affiliated with the resistance --
 we could make a dummy account or something, or pretend to be another person
 altogether.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She probably has weaker connections to the guard than most,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mused Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

because she's hidden so much of the time and Chelsea can't work on her incidenta
lly throughout the day like she can with everyone else...
 so something like that might work.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Razi,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, naming the teleporter witch who'd escaped the dungeon for
 good.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera could sneak up on him and take him apart and bring him home, especially
 if Demetri were still alive -- she's probably the only way he'd ever get
 recaptured.
 He'd be a believable source for a bribe offer.
 But what would he -- or anyone -- offer? The Volturi aren't cagey with
 their vast fortune when they're trying to keep their guard happy...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice, can you see Razi?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked abruptly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wrote off the possibility of getting him to help us before, because we
 had no way to find him, but even though he never managed to develop the
 ability to take passengers for all Addy's trying, he would be 
\emph on
outrageously
\emph default
 useful...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Plain as day.
 He's all over the place, though.
 He's in Shanghai -- aaaaand now he's underwater someplace -- that's France
 or at least someplace that has French on the signs -- a boreal forest of
 some kind -- the man cannot hold still, I'm going to get dizzy -- is that
 Tasmania?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I heard a pen scratching.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does his moving around mean that you can't share a vision with him?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are you writing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked, as Alice said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think so.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A description of Pera's power -- I'm leaving out Demetri's fate for the
 time being to make it sound more threatening -- and an offer to let him
 join us and a statement of where we are,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Razi doesn't have a mate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I remembered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe 
\emph on
he'll
\emph default
 wind up mated to Pera.
 He hasn't met her yet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'd better hope he winds up that way 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 agreeing to join us, and not before, if that's the case,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said gravely.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bella, is there anything you think I should add to the note?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell him he can contact us by writing something so Alice can see it, in
 case he has further questions,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother proposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now that is one way to go skydiving...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice muttered, presumably observing Razi teleport himself somewhere high
 above the ground.
 He usually didn't let himself hit bottom.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Say when.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We waited, silently, and then Alice said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Razi's voice from Siobhan's end of the phone connection, wary, but
 cordial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Welcome,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, would you like to join us to help catch our guest up on what's
 been going on?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

On my way,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, hopping to my feet and taking off down the mountain with a brief
 wave in my mother's direction.
 I kept the phone open and held to my ear in case more was said while I
 was en route.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who's Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Razi suspiciously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth is a half-vampire witch whose power involves being able to communicate
 very quickly and understandably,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You might remember me from when you escaped from the dungeon,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't notice you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As soon as I had my senses back I got out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I caused it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By replacing Addy's power.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Razi.
 It seemed like an awfully terse -- albeit sincere-sounding -- thing to
 say under the circumstances, but Memory informed me that Razi wasn't the
 type to attach extraneous words just to make the same basic message sound
 more context-appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're welcome.
 I'll be there in a couple minutes, and then I can tell you -- or show you
 -- whatever you want to know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, beginning to compose a summary in my head that carefully excluded
 pictures of Pera in case it was necessary to save that possibility for
 later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I look forward to it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, with the strange discontinous ripple in his voice that meant he
 was flickering from place to place mid-word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I turned up at the houses soon after.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Which house are you in?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked into the phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Over here in the gray, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, from the middle house of the three, and I ducked inside it;
 Siobhan and Razi were both in the large front hall, along with Alice, and
 the two American nomads Mary and Randall.
 I heard footsteps shuffling around up the stairs, and spotted Liam through
 the open door into the next room, where he kept an eye on his mate and
 the newcomer.
 Razi was swapping locations every second or two between the corner of the
 colorful rug and a spot three feet to the left of it.
 He'd shaved off what patches of hair his time in the dungeon had left him,
 presumably for a more even look than the patches of what had previously
 been a long head of black hair, and he had his arms folded and a skeptical
 look on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi, Razi,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want me to tell you anything specific, or just hit you with a summary
 of everything important straight off?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan was looking apprasingly at Razi's less-than-comfortable body language
 and location-jumping, and said to me, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why don't you just start with the part where we don't wish him any harm.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We don't wish you any harm,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I obliged.
 The teleportation slowed down a little, although he didn't relax his posture
 at all.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We just want your help.
 We don't like the Volturi, and want them to go away, and we figure you
 don't like them either, and would also want them to go away.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I copied his style of speaking deliberately, remembering that he tended
 to become impatient with more roundabout ways of talking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Approximately correct,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't dare jump into Volterra, though.
 I could land someplace where Alec is projecting a field, or close enough
 to Jane that she can knock me down, or something with one of the others
 who were in there with me -- I have no idea what they do -- could happen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With people helping you, the situation wouldn't be irrecoverable if something
 like that happened,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan pointed out.
 I had the impression that she was mimicking his style too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What, specifically, do you want me to do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We don't know yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, go ahead with the summary.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked to Razi for confirmation, and he nodded once, and I flung the condensed
 version of who was who and what information we had at him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Razi disappeared, and I opened my mouth to make some displeased sound, but
 Siobhan held up one finger.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Give him a minute.
 He could just be going someplace more comfortable to process everything.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sure enough, thirty seconds later, he popped back into place, newly damp
 and with a bit of seaweed clinging to his shirt.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You lead an interesting life,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he told me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Recently, yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I agreed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Want in?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll bail on you if it goes badly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he stated, twitching six inches to the right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 said Siobhan derisively, as though he was stupid to have bothered pointing
 out anything so obvious.

About a quarter of one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth here can reverse some of what Chelsea does -- the generative half,
 not the destructive half.
 Also, she's a wolf's imprint, and so wolves won't attack her.
 That means she can in theory enter the wolf village and deprogram them
 safely.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Won't they be expecting that?

 Razi asked, twitching to a spot behind me and then back to his original
 location.

I learned to deprogram people after leaving Volterra,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They don't know I can.
 They do know wolves won't attack me, but since that doesn't prevent the
 wolves from attacking anyone I bring with me, or holding me still, or telling
 the vampires I'm there, it wouldn't normally be that dangerous without
 the deprogramming on top of it.

\begin_layout Standard

Then what?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Razi said.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you know who Allirea is?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It just occurred to me that with Bella too far away to shield her, Elspeth
 will have neglected her existence.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Huh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.

Case in point.
 Well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Haven't heard of her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Razi said.

Why would Elspeth neglect her existence?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I rolled my eyes as Siobhan prattled to Razi about trivialities, again.
 I understood that we didn't need to feel too hurried, but it was such a
 waste of time even so.
 I watched Mary and Randall play backgammon, in a variation that seemed
 to be mostly about who could best get the dice to fall favorably via assorted
 methods of cheating.
 Alice was sitting at Tanya's harp, looking at it but not playing; as I
 observed she reached out and turned a page on the sheet music sitting on
 the nearby stand.

Elspeth,

 Siobhan said.

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We're done talking about boring, unimportant things now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Siobhan told me dryly.

You can stop zoning out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oh,

Good.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So apart from what I just discussed, and possibly Kate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan told Razi, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera is basically unstoppable.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wait,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

we have somebody besides Kate who could fight Pera?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan rolled her eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't matter, Elspeth.
 Anyway.
 Razi, even you could be in deep trouble if Pera snuck up on you and separated
 your head from your body.
 Since it's possible that Elspeth won't get any chance to deprogram her,
 the other thing we thought of was figuring out in advance via Alice if
 Pera will find a mate on our side, so we can plan around that.
 Nobody we've already signed on is a candidate, but...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You want me to have a look at her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Razi asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I suppose if she's my mate, at least that way I won't need to add `paranoia
 about a witch who can behead me on no notice' to the list of things that
 make me want to risk trying to teleport to the Moon...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can't see her just now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice told her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan frowned, then looked at me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As long as Alice can't do it, might as well give your communication style
 a try,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If it doesn't work we'll have Alice try when Pera's about to be visible
 again...
 if it does we'll have learned something new.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hold on a second,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Razi said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If Elspeth shows me Pera, and my reaction is something on the lines of `this
 woman is lovelier than the stars and I wish to spend the rest of my eternal
 life with her', what is it precisely that you want me to do after, presumably,
 dropping myself into her room and getting the reciprocal response? I can't
 teleport her here.
 How's she supposed to get out?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She can do that by herself if she wants,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She just has to hide and...
 walk out.
 They were very, very careful about turning her, because after doing that
 it became impractical to have Addy physically control her, and now they
 don't even 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 Addy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Speaking of which, do you know where Addy is so I can at least mildly injure
 her before she takes my power and escapes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Razi said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I owe her for putting me in that dungeon.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'd like nothing more than for you to displace the power we think she has
 now, which is mine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said with a sigh, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but we don't have her whereabouts.
 She's blocking Alice with a half-vampire or a wolf.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Damn,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyway.
 Let's have a look at Pera,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, looking back in my direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I offered him a purely visual memory of Addy's, for the benefit of vampirically
 clear vision and because of the fact that she was my only source of memories
 of Pera as a vampire.
 In theory, human Pera would have had the same effect, but it seemed like
 a better idea to present her in her current form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Razi tilted his head at a peculiar angle and quit flickering.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is she?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked in a low voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hang on, Alice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 muttered Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Are you planning to bring her back, Razi, or run off with her by yourself
 and forget about helping us with the Volturi?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Show me where Pera is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Razi said insistently to Alice, who shook her head once, and Siobhan frowned
 and dialed what sounded like Maggie's number.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are you doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm calling my lie-detector friend,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Convince said friend that you're going to do your best to convince Pera
 to come here, let Elspeth deprogram her, and help us -- again, I don't
 expect her to do anything other than flee at top speed if things go seriously
 south -- and Alice will show you where your mate is so you can go fetch
 her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Maggie's voice, and Siobhan recited a condensed version of the Razi-relate
d events, while the teleporter fumed and began jumping around the room again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do I know this isn't some kind of trap for her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How would we trap her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, bewildered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Kate has a kind of 
\emph on
defense
\emph default
 against her, potentially, but no offense.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you got her to unhide and Allirea was there -- ugh, never mind, you wouldn't
 understand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he snarled, red eyes flashing as he appeared standing on top of Mary and
 Randall's backgammon game.
 Randall hissed at him, annoyed, and Razi jumped back to his spot on the
 carpet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I blinked, puzzled, by this statement -- I had an awful lot of memories
 about what it was like to have a mate, in spite of lacking one of my own,
 so I thought it was reasonable to imagine that I 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 understand.
 But I let it go, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not only do we not have a way to hurt Pera, we wouldn't want to if we didn't
 have to.
 My mother wants to be queen of the world and use the hiding place as a
 kind of jail for vampires who break laws, as an intermediate step between
 letting people off with a warning and the death penalty.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Randall and Mary looked up at that.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How would the prisoners 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 exclaimed Mary, shocked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's actually kind of the idea, is that they would have to hunt animals
 or at least only drink blood that nobody died to produce,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.
 Randall shuddered, and looked like he might lodge some complaint, but Razi
 interrupted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell me where she 
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he snarled at Alice, appearing inches away from the tiny precog, and Jasper
 rushed into the room, a blur flashing down the stairs to stand near Alice
 and growl menacingly.
 Razi's hostile body language diminished, presumably as a result of Jasper
 practicing his empathy, and he flickered away from Alice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Siobhan said, offering Razi the phone.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Tell her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He snatched the phone out of her hand and brought it to his ear in one continuou
s motion.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he snapped.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When I find Pera I will attempt to talk her into joining this little group
 and its efforts to destroy the Volturi, with the `deprogramming' that implies.
 Satisfied?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He thrust the phone back into Siobhan's hand; Maggie's little voice trilled
 out of it a confirmatory response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Close enough,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, hit him with our contact information -- Razi, you seem to be in
 a hurry, so I won't bother you about obtaining a phone of your own today.
 You can just swipe one or teleport into somebody's house with a landline
 if you need us.
 But that means we'll have to ask Alice to show you a note if we need to
 get ahold of you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Of course he is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Siobhan replied, letting out a breath through her teeth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do you think he'll bother to stop back here, or just escort her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He has enough information to gather that we'll be able to notice his hiddenness,
 so he might assume there's no reason to check in if she agrees to come
 here.
 At any rate, Elspeth, you can go back to your wolf now unless there was
 something else here you wanted to accomplish.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This will make getting everybody onto a plane easier,

Pera can just hide us and we can walk right on.

That's

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We have cause for optimism, but there are still wild cards, including Pera's
 suggestibility.
 And the fact that we still don't know what Addy is up to.
 That said, yes, our transportational woes will be effectively over with
 Pera on our side.

Are we invincible if Pera decides to help us?

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Siobhan sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Their witches are better equipped to fight her than the few we've got.
 If Benjamin figures out where Pera is, he may be able to set her on fire
 by setting some object near her on fire.
 Vasanti's animals, like animals in general, are going to be in both the
 hiding place and outside, so Vasanti will be able to keep track of her.
 We don't know if Corin's shield or Emere's knife will go through to the
 hiding place, but they might.
 Li-qing's gravity adjustments will probably be just as able to catch Pera
 in midair as anyone else.
 Pera will be able to hear Pyotr if he commands her to do something whether
 she's hidden or not.
 Emel could at least inconvenience Pera with shaped metal getting in the
 way of whatever she was trying to do.
 And we don't know if Marcus's sight can observe people in the hiding place,
 but I would be surprised if it 
\emph on
couldn't
\emph default
, especially as long as the hidden person has relationships with unhidden
 people.
 No.
 We are not invincible.
 We are not even slightly invincible.
 But we have a fighting chance, now.
