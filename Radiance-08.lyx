Fader
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was nut-brown, lithe and broad-featured with dark hair shaved so close
 to her head that I couldn't determine its texture.
 She sat like a wild animal, clinging to the curved stone on the side of
 Carlo's head where his neck wound was and looking ready to leap or run
 or fight.
 There was a little blood on her lips, which she licked off as she returned
 my gaze with dark, considering eyes, but she hadn't gotten any on the drapey
 pale green wrap she was wearing.
 I thought the outfit looked vaguely Indian.
 But

Allirea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I guessed quietly, and she nodded once, expression unchanging.
 The Aborigine sister, the witch who could make herself seem irrelevant,
 which would explain why I hadn't noticed her until she decided to show
 herself.
 I sifted through recent memories.
 I'd definitely 
\emph on
seen
\emph default
 her.
 But she hadn't been important then.
 I would have paid attention to individual grains of grit in the corners
 of the cell before paying attention to her.
 Trying to focus on the memories of her from before she'd shown herself
 felt difficult.
 They weren't worth remembering, and things that I didn't decide were worth
 remembering could be forgotten -- I didn't recall if she'd been in the
 room with me when I'd woken or if she'd come in with Carlo -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 kill Carlo?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, frowning, trying to think through mud.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You were not going to eat him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shrugged Allirea.
 She had an Australian accent and a matter-of-fact tone.
 I was mildly surprised about the accent, because I knew she would have
 been born before Australia was colonized by English-speakers and there
 was no reason she should have that accent and not another.

He was not going to shut up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a vague idea that I should be upset about that, but surely 
\emph on
nothing
\emph default
 Allirea had done before letting me notice her was at all important; it
 was just clutter in my thoughts, she hadn't done anything worth noticing
 then, that was all.
 I pushed the useless notion away.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is the guard going to be upset if he hears me talk to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then she wasn't important anymore, and I sighed and wished the blood
 didn't smell so good.
 I picked at a loose thread on my sleeve.
 I wondered how long without food it would take me to get really impaired
 by hunger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea faded back in, and I blinked at her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You didn't answer my question,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I recalled vaguely.
 Well, an answer to my question 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 have been worth remembering, and I didn't remember it, so she hadn't.

Saeed!

 she yelled.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Allirea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the guard incredulously.
 He peered through the window.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The hell are you doing in there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Demetri will be angry with you if I tell him you put me here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said flatly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't put -- did I?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the guard, presumably Saeed.

Demetri will not care,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, her voice frosted with an imperious tone.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You are not a witch, you are not a useful fighter, you are only a minor
 guard of little use, and no one will object if he kills you.
 But perhaps I will not tell him, if you do something for me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What do you want?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Saeed suspiciously.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't let the prisoner out, that would 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 get me killed...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You do not have to let her out,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea, waving a hand.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I would like you to go away for two hours, and let 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 out when you come back.
 Obtain for her something that humans eat while you are gone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she suggested.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, and take this away.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She shoved Carlo's corpse, the knuckles of her hand into his shoulder;
 I was disturbed by the inert way he flopped back to the floor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saeed muttered to himself, but opened the door with his rubber gloves, picked
 up the dead man by the nearest arm, and tossed him into the hall.
 It was more of the same dark stone that made up my cell.
 The angle was wrong for me to see other doors, if there were any.
 He shut the door, and I heard him dragging Carlo off to whatever fate awaited
 drained humans.

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea waited patiently, perched on the sloped floor, until he wasn't audible
 anymore.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Saeed is not very attentive.
 He is a poor guard, and would not have been likely to pay mind to our conversat
ion even if I faded in and we spoke loudly.
 But now he is gone.
 I have been observing you.
 Did you know that your dreams leak out of your hands when you sleep?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said uncomfortably.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why have you been, uh, observing me?

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Chelsea has not touched you yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She is very busy with the new wolves, who must be molded as a unit.
 So

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are the wolves okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I interrupted.
 Allirea hadn't done anything hostile, so she might tell me, and I was worried
 about the pack too, although they were a distant second compared to Mama.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The puppies are in the nursery with the others, the wolves and the women
 are being seen to by Alec and Chelsea.
 While Alec is still there, there is something I need help with.
 Will you help me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After sparing a moment to wince at the idea of Chelsea working her witchcraft
 on the pack, I blinked at Allirea's request.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think I can do very much.
 I'm in a prison cell.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea waved a hand as though this were trivial.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can shelter you in my magic enough to let you walk out with me when Saeed
 returns to let me out.
 If my plan works, we will be able to escape afterwards.

\emph on
We
\emph default
 can escape?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, confused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You and me? Why would you want to leave? It sounded like Demetri was your
 mate.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She leaned forward, sudden intensity sparking her eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
I
\emph default
 am 
\emph on
his
\emph default
 mate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she snarled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But you and I, the hybrids, the master race, do not have those ties, those
 obsessions, those insanities.
 Only wolf men, and vampires, have that parasite in their minds.
 Like 
\emph on
Demetri
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She spat his name.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And this means that I cannot fade from his notice, there is no magic that
 will let him ignore me, no distraction that will let him deem me unimportant,
 no plea that will make him leave me alone, and he can find me anywhere,
 track me to any corner of the earth, and he is faster than me and stronger.
 The Volturi value him and will not be deprived of his service for the sake
 of my will or my sanity, and so while I can threaten 
\emph on
idiots
\emph default
 like Saeed with his wrath and make good on the threat if I am willing to
 play the part of the wronged mate for a while, I am no freer than you are.
 I could walk out, yes, pass unnoticed through the front door and run wherever
 I liked, but he would find me and think I meant only to play a game with
 him and he would pick me up and laugh at my screams and claim his 
\emph on
prize
\emph default
 and carry me back to Volterra.
 I run away often.
 He 
\emph on
finds
\emph default
 me, always.
 This time I want to kill him.
 I will give you anything it is in my power to give if you will help me
 
\emph on
kill him
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very ugly scenario spun into view in my mind, and I thought of the sickening
 sounds of a laughing vampire and a screaming girl who couldn't convince
 him that he wasn't welcome, that she didn't feel the way he did, that it
 wasn't symmetrical and fated and perfect.
 Trying to avoid imagining any finer detail of that -- 
\emph on
that
\emph default
, which I could vaguely understand I had only escaped by the sheer luck
 that Jacob was not a psychopath, which Allirea could not 
\emph on
possibly
\emph default
 deserve even if she killed people (and she probably did) -- I said instead,

Allirea calmed a little and shrugged at me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is what Father calls us.
 His purpose in conceiving me and my sisters and our brother.
 We are born, not made; we have the recourse of sleep; we can survive on
 different foods if we must; we can bear children.

That last was startling.

By humans or vampires, either,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Allirea, twisting her mouth into a grimace.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perhaps by wolves, but that I have not tried.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I shivered at the implications that she'd 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tried
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with a vampire -- probably a specific vampire.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have three, by humans, and they are much like us, a little slower perhaps.
 I managed to kill 
\emph on
his
\emph default
 children before they were born, my small revenge, but Noemi once took a
 vampire lover -- not a mate, only a momentary interest -- and her son is
 also quite like us, a little faster, less willing to eat plants and other
 repulsive items.
 We do have time to talk about these things,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but first I want to know if you will help me.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I've never killed anyone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I -- I don't think I can.
 Not just because it's killing someone, but he's a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she assured me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Teeth and matches and the element of surprise.
 That last is my weapon.
 Anyone other than 
\emph on
Demetri
\emph default
 may think me unimportant even as I take them apart -- though Renata can
 turn me aside without knowing I am present, and Marcus can see me coming
 by the threads of relationships that are only half-me, and even I find

Heidi?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She goes by that, yes.
 Adalheid is too beautiful to kill, and I am not immune to Chelsea anyway
 or I think I would have managed to slaughter the whole of the guard for
 their crimes of inaction against me.
 But my plan does not call for you to try to kill Demetri, not by yourself.
 The trouble is that I think your power fights mine.
 I've tried to fade you, while you were asleep, and could not shelter you
 from notice half so well as I can others.
 Do you know how to make your...
 
\emph on
self
\emph default
 stop 
\emph on
announcing
\emph default
 itself so loudly?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she asked.

If you don't I can kill Saeed and we might escape that way...

\begin_layout Standard

It calms down when I lie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The less truth in something I say -- about myself, not just about anything
 necessarily -- the less it works.
 Like -- `My name is Jennifer, I'm from Memphis.' Did that tone it down enough?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm not Jennifer and I've never even 
\emph on
been
\emph default
 to Memphis.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It helped,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Allirea.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Probably enough to get us out without my having to kill Saeed.
 You will need to mutter lies constantly, though.

 With Adelaide's help she

Adelaide?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I do not call her by her 
\emph on
ridiculous
\emph default
 nicknames,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea derisively.
 Nicknames? 
\emph on
Addy?
\emph default
 I guessed silently, thinking of the witch by that name Mama had told me
 about.
 
\emph on
Del? If they're the same person...

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nicknames are for children.
 When 
\emph on
Adelaide
\emph default
 helps, when she copies Chelsea and they work together, they are much more
 powerful than Chelsea alone, but there still must be a seed of something
 to coax it into bloom.
 I had a week to learn to hate Demetri before I was ever near Chelsea, and
 there are no seeds.
 I have made 
\emph on
very sure
\emph default
 that there are no seeds, because more than anything I am terrified of becoming
 
\emph on
attached
\emph default
 to him and losing any hope of revenge or freedom.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 My head was spinning with all the new information, and with the necessity
 of forcing down awful thoughts about Allirea and Demetri, and trying to
 think of sufficiently false things to say that they'd suppress my witchcraft
 and let Allirea hide me for her plan -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's your plan?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alec is holding the wolves and their women while Chelsea works on them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Allirea said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You are not one of the wolves, who must be handled as a group, and you are
 not a weak and easily-molded human, so you are set aside to be separately
 handled.
 While Alec does work there, though, he does not watch over the witches
 in the dungeon.
 Often they are kept in pieces, but it has come time to feed them, and for
 that they must be whole, though not necessarily awake.
 Adelaide has borrowed Alec's power, and is keeping them unconscious while
 they are fed, which is a tedious process.
 Adalheid must bring extra prey, make several trips far afield.
 The guard given the task of feeding the witches must satiate themselves
 as much as possible so they can handle the blood without drinking it themselves.
 The witches' food must be extracted from the prey, the food poured into
 the witches' mouths by funnel and

Wait, 
\emph on
what
\emph default
? Witches in the dungeon?

\end_inset

 I asked incredulously, interrupting the gruesome description of how to
 feed an unconscious vampire.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With Adelaide, it is not necessary to win a witch's allegiance before he
 or she can be useful to the Volturi,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Even a witch with no seeds of loyalty for Chelsea to coax into flower can
 be copied.
 So of course such witches are broken into fragments, and allowed to heal
 and feed under Alec's -- or Adelaide's -- supervision before being broken
 again.
 But 
\emph on
now
\emph default
, they are whole, and not watched by Alec himself, and with 
\emph on
your
\emph default
 help there will be a jailbreak.

Suppose,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that I go into the dungeon, faded as far as I can fade, and I tap Adelaide
 on the hand.
 She will copy my power and lose Alec's, and the witches will wake.
 But then she will be able to fade and, unnoticed, break the witches into
 pieces again.
 She will borrow their powers in place of mine as she does so, of course,
 but these are powerful, prized witches, and Adelaide is more than clever
 enough to use the surprise my fading will give her to put them all down
 in the right order.

I cannot plan on that; Chelsea has been unable to make these prisoners loyal

I run away often, after all.
 I am always found and brought

 I can be left waiting for him to retrieve me -- but the secret of the witches
 in the dungeon is one the Volturi have tried hard to keep.
 It improves their reputation, when every coven that has seen Adelaide reports
 on her as bearing a different terrifying power.
 It maintains their facade of authority, when they are still rumored to
 kill those who defy them and leave lie those who obey their laws, rather
 than this half-death inflicted for greed and not justice.
 And so it will be very urgent that the witches be found and brought back,
 and Demetri is the tracker.

 Before he starts breaking the witches again, I touch Adelaide.
 There will be pandemonium but I have to keep muttering lies.
 Then I will be picked up and carried out of the compound and out of the

After the two hours Saeed had been told to spend out of earshot, I heard
 his footsteps -- soft clunky noises of rocky vampire feet on the stone
 floor.
 He opened the door and threw me a paper bag with a grease stain on it --
 my food -- and I was supposed to be lying, but I was 
\emph on
really hungry
\emph default
, and I couldn't do a lot of lying with my mouth full, and eating seemed
 like a higher priority.
 I opened the bag and popped something that looked like a croquette into
 my mouth.
 But I did need to walk out of the room and I needed to start muttering
 lies first.
 For some reason.

 I ate another croquette.

 I announced softly, and surveyed the room.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The room was about thirty feet long and half as wide.
 At the end near the door, facing the rest of the room, stood a plump vampire
 woman in a flower-patterned skirt and a T-shirt from the Associazione Volontari
 Italiani Sangue.
 I nearly burst out laughing, but instead told myself severely, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That is not even a 
\emph on
little
\emph default
 funny.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Her eyes were burgundy, and sat in an innocuously bored-looking face.
 She had her brown hair in a careless bun, and if I'd seen her walking down
 the street in some more normal context with normal-colored eyes, I would
 have suspected she was a housewife.
 Given her actual location I thought she was probably Adelaide.

The other vampire moving about in the room, wrapped up in a Volturi cowl
 with the hood shadowing his face, was taking some care to keep out of the
 way too.
 He was hugging the walls as he walked.
 He held the funnel through which he was feeding the prisoners, and the
 container full of blood he poured through it, with long tongs.
 I glanced down at the witches.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of them had any clothes on.
 That made sense, since they were just going to be shattered into tiny pieces
 which couldn't wear clothes again -- or rather they would be if I didn't
 have my plan -- I was pretty sure my plan involved the witches not being
 broken into tiny pieces.
 I wasn't too disturbed by that, after a few days living with the wolves

was

 I whispered.
 I looked away again; the one witch's face I'd looked at closely was enough

 I counted feet instead, and there were sixteen pairs of feet in two rows,
 facing towards the middle of the room.

I continued counting up, mechanically, and bolted down a croquette every
 five sentences while waiting for the guard feeding the witches to finish.
 He was nearly through, only one more witch to pour blood into -- the same
 one I'd looked at, with an olive tinge to his skin and a square jaw, nearest
 the door.
 I was claiming to be seventy-six when the last of the liquid was tipped
 into his mouth.
 It looked like swallowing was a reflex that Alec's power didn't affect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was supposed to do something, when the last witch was fed.
 I had this memorized.
 I consulted my memory, still counting.
 The guard put down the container that had held the blood and the funnel,
 and picked up what looked like a long-handled 
\emph on
saw
\emph default
, except its teeth were real teeth -- vampire teeth, I supposed, sharp enough
 to incapacitate a vampire at a distance so the guard wouldn't fall prone
 like the victim.
 I shivered and tried not to wonder who the teeth had belonged to.

\begin_layout Standard
Pandemonium, as expected, broke out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adelaide made a choking sound, and there was a flurry of movement from the
 witches as they sprang into alert postures.
 The guard's saw was knocked out of his hand and I had to duck it as it
 went flying, and there was a horrible screeching as he was ripped apart
 by vengeful witches.
 Most of them bolted for the door, but one man 
\emph on
vanished
\emph default
 and two were cooperating on grinding the guard to dust first.
 All of them had the sense not to touch Adelaide, who looked very confused
 and was no faster than they were.
 She reached out for one, but he kicked her in the stomach and she hit the
 wall behind her, and her shirt got in the way of a power transfer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I said I was eighty-five, and then glanced over at the witches who remained.
 The two who'd dismantled the guard dropped the last fragments and raced
 out of the room after the others.
 One was just standing there, staring into space nearly as glazedly as if
 he were still affected by Alec's power.
