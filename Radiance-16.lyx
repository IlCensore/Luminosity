\begin_layout Chapter
Seeder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went to assembly, and tried to feel something while Chelsea hovered behind
 the back row of villagers in our pack's section.
 But there was nothing, no sensation, no 
\emph on
perceptible
\emph default
 change in my dispositions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did notice that I always felt happier and cozier right after an assembly.
 That was part of why I did my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meditating
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 right 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 each one -- it was just too hard to pick at that secure, warm feeling of
 being surrounded by all my friends when it was fresh.
 So I let myself go to bed with that just as snugly fastened as Chelsea
 could make it, and only when it had nearly a day to wear off on its own
 did I start poking at it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 wear off on its own, a little -- as far as I could tell for something that
 felt like nothing.
 Magic told me that a major effect of Chelsea's witchcraft was to influence
 who I made excuses for, so I took inventories of how I was inclined to
 explain or condemn various people's behavior in various situations.
 I felt more neutral at lunchtime than bedtime.
 But on its own, without the people from my old life actually there to build
 new relationships with me, neutrality was all I ever approached.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It occurred to me to wonder whether I really wanted to be anything other
 than neutral.
 Being surrounded by friends was happy and cozy -- 
\emph on
and that was exactly my problem
\emph default
.
 If it weren't happy and cozy, then Chelsea wouldn't be so good at keeping
 the village penned up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My relatives, on the other hand, never brainwashed me, but raising someone
 from early childhood could be almost as effective, and it would be awfully
 lucky if I'd just happened to be born into a perfect family who I really
 ought to consider faultless.
 So it might be that I shouldn't be all happy and cozy with them either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neutrality is very lonely, though.
 And I hate being alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't explain to Jake what was going on, since I wasn't prepared for
 the whole pack to know, but I did start spending more time with him.
 Regarding me, at least, he was impervious to Chelsea.
 Ultimately, my choices were to hang around him or abandon him, and even
 if some of the affection on 
\emph on
my
\emph default
 end was fake, it still seemed like a mean thing to do when he was completely
 innocent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I taught him to waltz, and when Daphne invented a ball game to be played
 on wolfback we gave that a try, and he told me stories and I showed him
 memories, and we always sat together at meals, and every evening he watched
 my dreams for a few hours before he went to bed.
 Jake was absurdly happy.
 That made me happy, too -- and guilty, because it made it so much more
 tempting to stay put, and whenever I thought of doing it my magic itched.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I asked Magic one day, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What if I just 
\emph on
like
\emph default
 it here and want to stay? Why do you have to badger me into trying to leave?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can make up our mind to stay if you decide that you want to live here,
 
\emph on
without leaving anything out
\emph default
 when you tell yourself why,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Magic implacably.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that, I didn't know how to do.

Benjamin and Tia are still doing well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy a couple of days later.
 She'd started dropping by daily, but usually just showed me a handful of
 her more innocuous memories for practice and then left.
 I was starting to get used to the sensation of tasting magic that she experienc
ed when she copied a power (which was always, because she could only get
 rid of one by replacing it with a different one), and I could often even
 keep my eyes open and look at things that were really present while she
 sent along the experiences.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We've decided that Chelsea's work based on seeds you plant is no less stable
 than the ordinary variety.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's been almost two weeks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did it really take that long to verify?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, but it seemed wise to be cautious,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If we got cocky and asked you to seed all of the witches at once on the
 grounds that Benjamin and Tia were acclimating, and we were wrong, I'm
 sure you can imagine the chaos.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked down.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You want me to seed the rest of them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And their mates, where applicable,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 She touched one finger to my chin and tipped my head up.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, I said I wouldn't interfere with your meditations until you tried
 to leave, but I'm sure you can understand that it wouldn't take 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 reporting the behavior to get you in trouble, if you do something suspicious
 like refuse the job.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought Aro didn't dare to annoy you too much?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, wondering for the first time why that would be exactly.
 Addy wasn't immune to Renata; she couldn't attack Aro directly even if
 she borrowed some useful combat power, and while some long-distance witchcraft
 might help, Addy would still be outnumbered enough to have no chance at
 escaping with her life.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And vice-versa, I'm afraid,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy lightly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You said if Aro found out
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then you would remain free to experiment,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 is -- how interesting, the way your power interacts with honesty -- that
 is what I want from you.
 I have no way to improve on borrowed powers by myself, you see.
 If I want the improved version of some ability, the witch who has the ability
 natively must master the new aspect.
 I believe you heard the story of how Pera was initially captured? We'd
 been acquainted some years before, which is how I got close enough to grab
 her, and I helped her develop her witchcraft for that reason; it's so much
 more useful now.
 Aro does not dare annoy me to the point of depriving me of your capacity
 to expand your power, so I suppose it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 fair to say that you aren't going to die.
 But he knows exactly how little it would annoy me if, for example, you
 were to prove dangerous and needed to do that experimentation under...
 let's say, Jane's supervision.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stared at her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you understand, Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes ma'am.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said with a broad smile, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why don't we go introduce you to Zafrina?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't lie to her, not by magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told Addy while I followed her through the tunnel to the compound.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know.
 You don't need to,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chelsea just needs seeds, not full-blown adoration.
 And the hard part with Zafrina is already mostly done; she has no mate,
 only `sisters', who don't miss her anymore and who she doesn't miss.
 She's very lonely right now, Elspeth, and you're going to fix that for
 her without telling a single lie.
 You only need convince her that things aren't as one-sided as they seem.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chelsea met us at the mouth of the tunnel, and Addy asked me if I knew anything
 about Zafrina already.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A little.
 She's from the Amazon coven and does visual illusions,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And once she knows you're there, that means she'll be able to communicate
 with you directly, by sending you an impression of writing.
 I'll still coach you, of course.
 However, I should warn you that she could be hostile at first, and might
 try to scare you off with distressing illusions.
 Closing your eyes won't help.
 So I actually recommend that you keep your eyes closed.
 That way you will know that anything you see is something she's showing
 you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went to the dungeon with them, and Addy pointed at a heap of rubble, and
 I shut my eyes and reached out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That day, I seeded four witches including Zafrina, all unmated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the illusionist, there was Charles, a truth detector.
 I remembered my mother describing Maggie to me, who was the opposite --
 and to hear Addy describe Charles's power, considerably less powerful.
 Charles could tell the difference between 
\emph on
kinds
\emph default
 of truth, and wouldn't be thrown off by sarcasm or misdirection.
 Essentially, he was only convinced that he was hearing something honest
 if the person talking to him was forthright enough to keep Magic happy
 -- which made me probably the only person who could talk him into letting
 seeds sprout, even leaving aside the part where he was in pieces and difficult
 to speak to.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy cheerfully, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

even if you aren't 
\emph on
absolutely
\emph default
 transparent, your power does help you sound honest as long as you aren't
 truly lying! I think that will close the gap, should you happen to feel
 that you would be 
\emph on
most
\emph default
 effective by telling him less than absolutely everything.
 If it doesn't work, we'll come up with a new strategy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It worked.
 Chelsea laughed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there was Dwi, who -- like Zafrina -- could talk back without going
 through Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a bit like your father,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy explained when she pointed out his pile among the rows of them.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Except he has no range limit and goes in both directions -- and only picks
 up and sends voluntary communications.
 He's a useful telephone, more or less -- who works underwater, in silence,
 regardless of whether there's bars in the area or not.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She laughed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The wolves work nearly the same way, except that they can't speak in the
 form that lets them have the ability, and only talk to others in their
 packs, so Dwi's power is faster in emergencies.
 We 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 talk to him ourselves, but he wouldn't believe us and is particularly unfond
 of me -- you, he'll have a harder time dismissing like that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Li-qing was last for the day (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wouldn't want to worry your wolf, and I'm sure you don't either,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

so four will do until tomorrow,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and she had what Addy described as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

minor gravity control
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That is to say, she can designate a new direction as `down' within a limited
 range,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy explained.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's a fun one.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt sick to my stomach after we were done, and Chelsea humming happily
 to herself while she made little finger-twitches to accompany her work
 didn't help.
 Addy escorted me back to the village.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake asked me what was wrong, when I walked in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tricky day at work,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured, and he hugged me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy was back after breakfast the next morning, caught me in the hallway,
 winked at Jake, and led me by the hand up into the compound again.
 I listened in silence while she told me who I'd be seeding during the walk
 through the tunnel.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice and Jasper -- you know them -- I'd start with Jasper if I were you,
 he really rather approved of the Volturi before he thought we'd killed
 Alice.
 Go ahead and roundly blame all of that on my study of witchcraft; we can
 fix up his attitudes towards 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 later once he's thrown in with the Volturi as a group.
 I'd have grabbed him too and he'd never have needed to despair of her if
 only it hadn't been so tempting to try his power to fake her death.
 It was a marvelous piece of work -- and he never suspected! I think Alice
 will follow easily once he's in hand.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded once, concentrating on breathing and walking and the fact that
 soon there wouldn't be any more witches in the dungeon to seed and I could
 get on with -- whatever I wanted to get on with.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Next,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you can see about managing Hao and his mate Kazuo.
 Kazuo's not a witch, but he shouldn't be hard to handle either, and Hao's
 a telekinetic.
 Limited, though.
 I worked with him for a solid six months back in 1805, and he's still stuck
 on small, inanimate objects in a limited range that he can see.
 Very dexterous, though.
 Ask him how much art he's going to get done as-is.
 Plus there's the mate angle, of course, you remember working with Benjamin
 and Tia.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did remember that.
 I hadn't seen them since.
 I hoped they were comfortable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And then Sukutai, the walking -- well, `slightly quivering' at the moment
 -- perfect camouflage witch.
 Herself, anything she touches -- she can fix it up to have whatever color
 she likes.
 You'll be able to tell who she is all by yourself; she likes to stay brown
 instead of being pale like the rest of us, although she can't do a thing
 about the sparkles.
 She's got a mate too, Okey.
 He's not a witch, and his color from Sukutai has worn off, but I'll point
 him out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that all for the day?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked softly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, that will do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy replied pleasantly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She watched and gave instructions, and Chelsea smiled and fluttered her
 hands, and I seeded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were two more days of seeding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I listened attentively when Addy told me about who I was helping to brainwash,
 feeling like it was somehow better if I at least knew their names.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Emere's from New Zealand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No mate.
 You know the drill.
 Her power is like Corin's, but she has an invisible knife, not a shield.
 Quite sharp enough to hack up a vampire if that's what she chooses to do
 with it, although she's fairly nonviolent considering.
 Taamusi melts or freezes water -- I tried and tried and 
\emph on
tried
\emph default
 to get him working with vapor or at least steam, but it didn't work, most
 witches are so constrained -- and he has a mate Valdis, whom you will also
 need to seed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded once.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And then you will finish up by working with Pyotr.
 He doesn't have a mate.
 His power is unwieldy even at the best of times -- he can't make it work
 at all, four times out of five, and I can't discern any regularity to it,
 which is frustrating -- but when it does work, he's dangerous indeed.
 Compulsion.
 If he's functioning properly and he tells you to do something, that's what
 you shall do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked at her hand on my wrist, pulling me along the tunnel, and permitted
 myself to think that I knew a little about how that worked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last day, I seeded Vasanti and her mate Mehul.
 They were both witches, but Mehul's power was minor enough that he wouldn't
 have been worth capturing on his own; he had slightly better hearing relative
 to an average vampire.
 Vasanti, on the other hand, was the only vampire in the world known to
 be non-repulsive to animals.
 They would willingly approach her -- liked her, in fact, and would tolerate
 other vampires in order to be close to her as long as there weren't too
 many of them.
 And at her option she could possess one animal at a time, perceiving its
 senses as additions to her own and controlling its body like an extension
 of hers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that pair were two last, unmated vampires: Abdelmajid, who could see
 through solid objects, and Emel, a woman who could control metal the way
 Benjamin could manipulate earth and stone.
 Emel was last, because the teleporter Razi was still at large.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I caught Razi in the first place much the same way I did Pera,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sighed Addy wistfully.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I got him to hold still and talk to me while I had Alec's power, and he
 needs his proprioception to jump from place to place so once I'd managed
 to knock him down he was all set, but now I'd never be able to keep him
 in sight long enough.
 He may be a permanent loss.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is Pera, anyway?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I would have thought she'd be in the village sometimes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And why would you think she would do that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Addy, smiling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To visit Brady...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I blinked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I...
 haven't seen Brady since two weeks ago, while Pera was turning.
 Is he living up here with her? Wouldn't that make Alice less useful?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy just smiled at me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I noticed that I did not 
\emph on

\emph default
 Brady.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I let Addy take me home, and curled up with Jake on our sofa and tried not
 to cry.

that while I like to keep witches around to borrow after they've hit their

 None of the witches you've seeded is

You did a very nice job.
 And now the only witch we still have to keep in pieces is your father,

 I'm sure we will acquire more witches in the future, but Dwi will be able

Since you are only slightly useful,

 she told me,

I would like you to be interesting.
 Learn new and exciting things.
 Figure out the limits of what you can already do, and push them.
 I'll help you if you should slow down, of course.
 I do have a history of being good at helping witches improve.

Where itchy magic hadn't done the trick to make me want to leave the village,
 stark terror did.
 It was no longer particularly difficult to peel away the snuggly comfort
 of induced awe and respect and affection for the vampires who lived in
 the compound, although I retained what I thought was a justifiable level
 of sympathy for the other villagers.
 But I had no way of knowing when Addy had my father's power and when she
 didn't; and whenever she did, she could tell what I was up to -- what I
 was 
\emph on
thinking
\emph default
.
 She'd know if I decided to jump from my bed to the skylight and climb up
 to break through the glass at the surface.
 She'd know if I talked my way past the tunnel guards and intended to make
 a break for it once past the pawn shop.
 She'd know if I talked Jake into digging us out.
 And if she thought she wouldn't be able to research my power otherwise,
 she'd have every motive to turn me in.

\begin_layout Standard
As unwelcoming as the village had become, I was pretty sure my life could

\begin_layout Standard
I had no reason to believe that the Volturi wouldn't kill Jake if he protested
 at my treatment, so I had to make sure there was nothing (that he could
 see) about my treatment to complain about.
 I had to do what Addy wanted.
 I had to make it clear to her, to anyone else curious enough to investigate,
 that I was staying put and didn't need to be taken away from him.

I catalogued how my power had progressed so far, hoping to collect ideas
 for what to try next.
 The first thing I ever did was transmit visual memory.
 Later I'd attached feelings.
 Dreams had started leaking out of my hands at some point -- it could have
 been earlier than it was discovered, although not by much, if my parents
 hadn't held my hands while I slept before that night.
 I'd added senses to my shared memories, one at a time, and learned to construct
 hypothetical situations (tagged as such when I sent them to prevent me
 from lying with them).
 I pared down the hypothetical situations to just words so I could talk
 silently.
 My power started leaking on its own into my normal speech, adding credibility
 to my true statements depending on just how true and complete they were,
 and prompting me to say things in ways that my audience would understand.
 I taught myself to confirm guesses about other people in a horribly roundabout
 fashion.
 More recently I learned to summarize and translate memories, and in just
 the last few weeks I'd been talking to my own magic.

I pulled my hand away from my face.
 I didn't know what Addy would do if I told her my magic wouldn't help me
 be interesting because it was unhappy.
 I didn't really want to find out.
 But I'd learned to do new things before my power became a personified truth-obs
essed sub-agent of me, so maybe I didn't need Magic's willing cooperation.
 I started brainstorming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy checked up on me (in person) a couple of days later, while Jake was
 playing poker in East with some other wolves.
 She'd sent me an e-mail at my village account telling me to arrange to
 be alone.
 It had been a difficult task to convince Jake that I was okay to leave
 alone, since try as I might I wore my heart on my sleeve and 
\emph on
everyone
\emph default
, especially Jake, could tell I wasn't very happy, but eventually I persuaded
 him to go.
 I had a list written up for Addy, which I pushed across the table at her
 when she walked in.
 I avoided making eye contact.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 She scanned my list.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Compression and speed...
 hm, you could be a little backwards Aro, wouldn't that be interesting?
 Range...
 that's good if you can manage it, especially since a lot of people who
 acquire range after starting with none can keep training it up a fair distance.
 You've crossed out `weaponize the disorientation effect', why's that? I'd
 find it very interesting...
 you can save it for later, though, if you prefer.
 Learning to talk to your magic via means other than sign language...
 not very useful, but it's something, I suppose, and we've established that
 you don't need to be 
\emph on
particularly
\emph default
 useful.
