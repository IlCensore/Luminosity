The Reveal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the bell rang, I was at the stove, giving the lentils a stir and pouring
 in a little more water.
 I left the spoon in the pot and went to answer the door.
 It was Alice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hello, Bella,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello, Alice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can I help you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

May I come in, please?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought about this.
 Charlie wouldn't likely object to my having her over; although I didn't
 have any classes with Alice, she was a peer in some sense, and he swore
 up and down that she and her family were the ideal sort of people.
 Besides, if I was ever going to figure out the answers to my questions,
 it would probably involve talking to some Cullens at some time.
 I stood aside and waved Alice into the house; she pranced inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Want some lentils?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked idly, gesturing at the pot on the stove.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're sort of related to chickpeas, I think.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I already ate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you very much anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded and sat down at the kitchen table; Alice did the same.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Be patient with me, please,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said, looking pained.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have a lot to tell you and I've never had to explain it before and it's
 
\emph on
really complicated
\emph default
 and my family is going to be angry at me, but there's no other way, I 
\emph on
looked
\emph default
, there's really not.
 You've got to know, and sooner's safer than later.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I, um, register a general approval of knowing things rather than not, and
 of safety,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you think you're going to be able to explain what you want to explain
 before Charlie -- I mean, my dad -- gets home?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice confidently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He won't get back until after eight.
 The basics won't take longer than that.
 You're going to want extra proof, but we can meet some other day and take
 care of it.
 So, uh, first -- I can predict the future.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded slowly, inviting her to go on.
 My crazy idea was looking less crazy.
 If Alice believed of 
\emph on
herself
\emph default
 that she could predict the future, 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 I'd independently thought of it -- it was still wildly unlikely, but she
 was willing to let me test it, apparently, and that sure was 
\emph on
something
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, passing me a folded sheet of paper.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's the weather for the next week.
 I know that weather reports are sometimes right and that Forks is easier
 to guess than anywhere else, but weather's easy for me, and I put everything
 down to the minute.
 I can do physical events like that with no trouble.
 I can tell what people are going to do if they've made their decisions
 -- if they might do any of several things I get less clear images, but
 not nothing -- but minds can always change.
 So weather's one of the best tests.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I unfolded the sheet of paper.
 It specified heavy rain until 11:09 that evening, after which brief sleeting
 was called for, and then a subdued drizzle would dominate the night.
 She'd thrown in a rainbow for Thursday morning.
 I folded the paper back up.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dice?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I proposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cards would be better.
 How you shake the dice matters, but once you shuffle cards they stay put,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can do better than chance with dice if you prefer them, though.
 Oh, but you have a dice cup.
 I can do perfectly with dice too that way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got some of both from the cabinet under the stairs and offered Alice a
 sheet of paper.
 I shuffled the deck several times and she filled her page with predictions,
 writing rapidly and with perfect penmanship.
 Then I took the paper and flipped through each card in succession.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She got them all right.
 I didn't bother repeating the cards right away; time was limited and I
 already had more information than I could readily explain.
 Charlie indeed owned a dice cup, which Alice said would let her get all
 of the dice perfect as long as I hid the cubes under it for a moment after
 shaking them.
 She was right sixteen times in a row, at which point I swept the dice out
 of the way and planted my elbows on the table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you do it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I honestly 
\emph on
don't
\emph default
 know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've been able to as long as I could remember.
 I focus on people, or things, and the possibilities show themselves in
 visions.
 No audio, but I'm okay at lipreading; they're not always very clear, and
 it gives me headaches to focus on really indecisive people.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As long as you can remember is -- how long?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're, what, my age? A year older?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm at least a hundred years old,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice evenly, maintaining steady eye contact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What? Wait -- at least?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I woke up in 1920 with no memories and looked about as old as I do now.
 I think I'm physically nineteen, but if I look old for my age -- I mean,
 the age I was when it happened -- then I could have been born as late as
 1905 or so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And when you woke up you could see the future,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 I wasn't sure if I was playing along or if I really bought the rest of
 the story along with her casino-busting tricks, but even if she were playing
 with me, outright lies were a change of pace from cryptic eccentricity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not -- none of my family is -- human.
 But I'm the only one who can't remember being one.
 We're not sure what happened to me; I can't see the past the same way I
 can see the future.
 The rest of them know more about where they came from.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And so you are a\SpecialChar \ldots{}
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vampire,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice, wincing a little.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please don't freak out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 really 
\emph on
don't
\emph default
 think I want you to prove that to me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I began carefully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, nonononono,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice, her eyes flying open very wide, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we don't drink human blood.
 Not my family.
 Animals only.
 Although it wouldn't be smart for you to watch us eating them, either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 That's why you guys never eat anything at school?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice winced.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know it's kind of conspicuous.
 It's not physically impossible for us to swallow normal food, but it's
 really, really unpleasant.
 And we can't digest it, so it just all comes back up later.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Charming mental image,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I remarked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that why you all look like you're made of chalk, too?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice nodded.
 I asked, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you ever consider wearing makeup?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They don't make the stuff to stay on our skin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, holding out an arm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go ahead,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I laid my palm on the back of her hand.
 She felt like a piece of rock.
 Cold, smooth, unyielding rock.
 I nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It'd all rub off as soon as we touched anything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, putting her arm back down.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So before you ask, most of the myths are false.
 We do drink blood, but have no unusual relationship with bats, no aversion
 to garlic in particular over anything else you might eat, don't sleep in
 coffins -- or at all, actually -- can't turn into smoke, and aren't harmed
 by sunlight.
 Although sunlight does make us kind of conspicuous, so we avoid going out
 in it in public.
 That's why we pick places like this to live -- cloud cover.
 A stake through the heart would be impossible -- there's no way you could
 drive a piece of wood through my eye, let alone my ribcage -- and decapitation'
s only an issue if we don't get everything reattached in a hurry.
 We can catch fire, though, so please don't try that one.
 We are very fast, agile, and strong, and have very acute senses.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice decided to illustrate this last sentence by getting up, jumping into
 the air, and landing on one hand, which she used to support herself with
 no visible effort.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

One comes to have more vampires than one had before by taking a human and
 adding venom.
 Easiest way to get that is from a bite, but according to Carlisle, if I
 cried into an open wound I could turn someone that way too.
 The process is not fun.
 I can't remember mine, and wasn't there for any of the others', but I am
 told that it takes three days and is emphatically not fun.
 You can't undo it.
 Afterward we don't age.
 We have to move around a lot so people don't wonder about that too much.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stared at her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She pushed off the ground, did a little flip, and landed on her feet, then
 sat back in her chair.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Questions?

Did I actually summon you here by deciding to go to Charlie, or was that
 a coincidence?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You summoned me, sort of, but please don't make too much of a habit of that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 firmed up we all flew into a panic.
 It would be a huge problem if police started investigating us.
 We'd have to move.
 Probably abroad for a while just to be safe, maybe split up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is this all of you, or are you split up from some others now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is all of our family.
 We have some friends up in Denali, and a few acquaintances scattered around
 elsewhere,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uh\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 why wouldn't it be a good idea for me to see you eat?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because when we hunt we're not thinking very clearly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice explained.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Humans smell a lot more appetizing than animals do.
 If we're hunting, and a human wanders by -- we might be able to pull back,
 I know Carlisle -- our father, Dr.
 Cullen -- could at least, but there'd be more risk than there is just attending
 school with us.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And attending school with you is\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 how much risk, approximately?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 A little shiver ran up my back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With me -- not much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said soothingly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or Rosalie or Emmett.
 Jasper has more trouble than most of us, but we look out for him -- if
 I saw him losing it I'd get him out of the building in plenty of time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She hadn't mentioned Edward.
 I looked at her pointedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Edward is\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 very controlled,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Normally I wouldn't think he'd ever be a danger.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Normally,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I prompted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice winced.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Um.
 Will you promise that you won't flip out and run away and never talk to
 Edward again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will promise no such thing!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I exclaimed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If Edward's going to drain my fluids like I'm a Cadbury creme egg I

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I really really really don't think he will!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shrilled Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't see it -- not anymore -- but you're right, you should know.
 Um, humans smell very tasty.
 And some humans smell\SpecialChar \ldots{}

 others.
 To\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 specific vampires.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

did he come back to school? I realize it's a

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ew,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Alice, wrinkling her nose.

No, I mean -- I'm not the only one with a power.
 Edward -- and Jasper -- have them too.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I cried.
 I'd been worried someone would steal my 
\emph on
notebook

 (I'd once considered actual code -- some simple cipher to make the writing
 opaque to a casual observer -- but I hadn't managed to develop one

 It was a tradeoff.) It had never crossed my mind that anyone would be able

Bella, he can't read

 You're completely opaque to him.
 You're the only one he's never been able to hear, but he can't, he really

Jasper can sense and affect moods in the people around him -- it's not a

 The vampire masquerade organizers' are called the Volturi.

 We have to keep our secrets, which means that if we create new vampires
 they have to be kept under control and we can't be conspicuous ourselves.
 Inconspicuousness doesn't usually mean avoiding feeding on humans, it just

 kill too many in any one place.

I couldn't come up with an ethical way to test Jasper's special ability

 Which I emphatically did not want to do.
 Enlisting an informed outside party would spill the family's secret if
 it was true; using uninformed outsiders would wrong them; using one of
 the other vampires would be a test of their acting skills, not necessarily
 Jasper's mood-altering mojo.
 After a moment's consternation, I decided to skip that test.
 I didn't think Alice would be lying or mistaken about Jasper's power

 If my other results all pointed at

 have chosen that particular supernatural claim to fabricate.
 For safety reasons, I also did not invent a test for the

I'd want to

 I said.

But not to be

.
 The reason I'm asking you to leave 
\emph on
my

 emotions alone, instead of telling you to stay away from my friends and
 whatnot, is that I can deal with my own and most people can't.
 If I start flailing hysterically near something sharp and also near Edward,
 you can warn me that hysteria is dangerous to me at that time.
 You know, using words.
 I do 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 a self-preservation instinct; I would not 
\emph on
choose
\emph default
 to be hysterical if it would likely get me killed.
 Although,

 I said, turning back to Edward, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

it may be that

you

Edward

 He looked a lot more lighthearted than the other vampires.

Point,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I acknowledged.

Uh, no pun intended.
 But anyway, Alice, you see me being a vampire, definitely, not a corpse?

Yes,

So it is something to be sure I'm sane about, but not something to rearrange

Car accidents are a fairly common cause of death among us fragile folk,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I reminded them, and comprehension dawned.
 Of course.
 If a vampire got in a car accident the worst case scenario -- the only
 scenario worth worrying about -- would be catching fire, and comparatively
 few accidents had that feature, in spite of cinematic embellishment making
 it look like cars were just 
\emph on
begging

Anyway,

I find myself pretty much taking what Alice said at face value, given the
 available snippets of evidence.
 However, as she predicted, I would like a little more proof.
 I've got a list.
 Two tests require somebody other than Edward or Alice to be valid tests
 of the things I'm looking for, and one is specifically of Edward.
 Can't compel participation, but I would appreciate it.

What've you got?

 asked Emmett.
 I took out my notebook, tore out the page, and handed it to the large vampire.
 Edward leaned slightly to look at it.

No,

 said Rosalie,

I don't.
 You don't need me anyway; the four of you can satisfy her curiosity doing

And Carlisle and Esme,

They'll be there.

 We're doing it Thursday.

Rosalie snorted and Emmett rolled his eyes.
 I had a moment of unkind speculation about the depth of that relationship.
 But for all I knew they'd been together for seven hundred years and there
 were vast reams of subtext I couldn't detect; at any rate, I had no reason
 to act on information about their love lives, so it didn't bear investigation.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Tomorrow?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I guess that works; I need to study for trig with Jessica this afternoon.

Alice nodded.
 With the important orders of business out of the way I took a bite of my
 macaroni and cheese, then started peeling my orange.
 The macaroni had flecks of bacon in it.
 I wondered if vampire taste sensations were anything like human ones --
 I'd have to ask a non-Alice vampire about that.
 It would be sad to give up normal food.

Lunch ended, and I -- flanked by Edward -- caught up with Angela and Mike.
 Mike gave Edward an annoyed look, which Edward responded to with a tight-lipped
 smile and narrowed eyes.
 None of us talked on the way, but I suspected we all had different reasons:
 Angela didn't mind silence, Mike didn't want to talk to Edward, Edward
 didn't want to talk to humans who weren't me, and I knew all of that and
 didn't want to oblige anyone to talk.
 We arrived at Biology and went to our respective seats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class was, as usual, something I'd done before -- the syllabus indicated
 we'd get to some fresh material in the next unit, which I hoped would be
 interesting, because Biology was increasingly tiresome as we went over
 more and more that I already knew.
 It occurred to me to wonder why the vampires were in high school.
 They moved a lot -- did they have to repeat high school over and over again?
 Or did they just do this occasionally, and at other times spend their days
 pretending to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

homeschool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and secretly pursuing whatever interested them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter would make more sense.
 I could see attending high school anew once every thirty years or so to
 get an update on the state of education -- they would always need to be
 able to pull off having attended high school 
\emph on
recently
\emph default
 -- but even if that was the goal, it would make more sense to go to college
 repeatedly and at least choose a different major each time.
 There was no reason the vampires couldn't pass as youthful college students,
 especially at a large, prestigious school that would tend to attract prodigies.
 Maybe they liked continuity more than I would have guessed, and preferred
 to segue into college with genuine secondary school histories.
 (Living as they did there had to be a source of forged records, of course,
 but they might not use them for absolutely everything.)

While the teacher talked about ribosomes I started speculating pointlessly
 on what sort of knowledge they must have acquired over their lives.
 Alice had hinted at knowing Korean.
 I couldn't think of any other clues, so I made things up to entertain myself,
 fabricating long lists of languages they'd speak and cities they'd explored
 and skills they had mastered and books they'd read and performances they'd
 attended -- there was so much to 
\emph on
do

 with life as soon as you took a few of the bars off the cage.

The thought of how much time would be freed up by the mere lack of a need
 for sleep was staggering.
 Not only the time spent sleeping, but also the time preparing for sleep,
 waking up from sleep, ensuring the comfort of the place in which one might
 sleep, managing threats to the peaceful environment such that one might
 sleep, and dealing with the interruption to any long-term pursuits due
 to sleep.
 That, and there was little to no risk attached to anything they could do
 that didn't call for sunbathing.
 No reason not to skydive.

I was warming up considerably to the idea of joining their ranks.
 Three days of

 up the fluids of those around me notwithstanding, I wanted immortality
