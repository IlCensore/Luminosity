There isn't time to argue,

 Mama said firmly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have all our things.
 We need to go, now.
 Come on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She started out -- east -- and I followed.
 She can't pick me up and run in a populated place because she doesn't look
 strong enough to do it.
 But she 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 drag me by the hand, if I refuse to go with her; I tried that once when
 I was two and a half.

\emph on
Why
\emph default
 do we have to go all of a sudden?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked.

What happened?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I smelled a wolf.
 Just a trace, but whoever it was will certainly have had the chance to
 notice our scents.
 We're going to Iowa City, we'll stay overnight, and then we're going to
 Peoria, where we will also stay one night, and then, unless I see anyone
 familiar or smell wolf again, we can find another town to stay in longer.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who was it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, jogging after her.
 We don't usually go to cities that big.
 They are more likely to have vampires in them, since humans are thicker
 on the ground and it's less obvious if one goes missing occasionally.
 Mama prefers towns big enough to have libraries, but only just.
 The sunnier the area, the bigger a town she'll risk.
 I guess she thought the wolves would stay out of cities or something.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said tightly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't tell one from another by scent alone, and I certainly didn't risk
 following the trail.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We got out of (human, nighttime) visual range of the town.
 She turned around and picked me up so she could start running.
 Even carrying me and all our stuff, she's faster than I am.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They might or might not be directly hostile, depending on the pack, but
 we can't take the chance.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 It makes me especially sleepy when Mama carries me, and I wasn't up for
 much more conversation than that.
 I nodded off.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I woke up, I was in midair, and my ears were full of wolves snarling
 and Mama shouting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was still dark, and I was terribly groggy.
 I landed on the ground, slid, and blinked, trying to figure out what all
 the noise was.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is one rule that Mama has that's very, very strict, but which I never
 actually had to follow before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When she says 
\emph on
run
\emph default
, I have to leave her and escape by myself if I can.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of the rule is that I am supposed to go in a random direction as
 long as I can possibly stay awake.
 I am supposed to gradually make my way to New York City or San Francisco,
 whichever's closer, however I can.
 We have a rendezvous point in Central Park and one in Golden Gate Park,
 each of which I've seen once.
 I am not supposed to worry about her, because worrying will not help keep
 me safe, and she will have better chances if she thinks I am safe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I get stuck, or I'm in some kind of danger I can't get away from without
 help, or if someone finds out what I am, I am supposed to call Grandpa
 Carlisle rather than keep trying to meet up with Mama.
 (If he doesn't answer the phone I am supposed to try Grandma Esme, and
 Aunt Rosalie, and Uncle Emmett, and everybody in the Denali coven, and
 the Irish coven starting with Gianna, the lady who gave birth to me, in
 that order.
 This is in case someone has changed their number or has their phone turned
 off.
 If I can't get hold of any of those people I am allowed to try Grandpa
 Charlie.) If I go to the rendezvous point every day for a month and she
 doesn't get there, I am supposed to call for help then too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have a story memorized about how another vampire, not Mama, kidnapped
 me and was finally killed by a coven that decided to let me live.
 I am supposed to tell Grandpa Carlisle and the rest of the family this
 story instead of telling them that I was with Mama.
 I am supposed to pretend to be traumatized and refuse to show any of the
 memories from that time.
 It's possible that she could live through some things that would still
 keep her from meeting me in the right park, so it all still has to be a
 secret as long as that doesn't put me in danger.
 If I ever meet the Volturi named Aro, I am supposed to throw an absolute
 tantrum and beg not to have to be near him on the grounds that he killed
 Daddy.
 If I have to let him touch me anyway, then I am supposed to deliberately
 send him all the memories of the months of my life before Mama found me
 in case this can confuse him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If they find out that Mama is or might be alive anyway, I am supposed to
 tell anyone who asks absolutely everything, and do whatever I have to to
 keep myself alive even if it means helping the Volturi find and hurt Mama.
 If I can, I am supposed to avoid the guard members named Chelsea, Addy,
 and Jane, and anyone else who is very likely to hurt me or make me think
 differently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm not so sure about the part where I'm to cooperate with the Volturi,
 but I understand the part about running.
 Mama is very tough.
 She explained to me how she survived when the Volturi tried to kill her.
 She might be able to do the same thing again, although she hasn't had a
 need to try it twice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I can't expect to hold up in a fight against even the stupidest, weakest
 vampire in the world.
 I can't escape from one who wants to catch me, either, but they 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 let me go if I try anyway, because that means I'm not trying to be a threat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't get a great look at the wolves, but running away I definitely heard
 at least three of them, all barking at the same time.
 Mama stopped screaming once I ran.
 I couldn't tell if she wasn't able to scream, or if she didn't see any
 need to bother after I was away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I ran, and ran, and kept running, and twenty minutes later when I thought
 I would trade my left arm for the chance to curl up in a ball and sleep,
 I noticed that a wolf was chasing me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was not part of the plan.
 I might actually be able to beat 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 wolf in a fight -- maybe -- if I'm not tired.
 Their advantage against vampires is only that they come in groups and work
 together well, so one of them isn't as dangerous even to someone who is
 not a proper vampire, like me.
 But I wasn't supposed to fight, I was supposed to run.
 I can't really outrun wolves either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being tired also makes it harder to run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was tired.
 I hadn't been going at top speed to begin with, and steadily slowed down
 from there, and I almost hit a tree.
 When I dodged it, the wolf was there to meet me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was 
\emph on
huge
\emph default
.
 Mama told me all about werewolves, and how big they can get, but it's different
 seeing one up close.
 I only got a split second to look at it before it planted both paws on
 my front and shoved me into the tree I'd just gone around.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't know if I hit my head on the tree wrong, or if my need for sleep
 just picked that moment to force me unconscious, but I was out like a light.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing I noticed when I woke up was that Mama wasn't holding my
 hand.
 She 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 did, even if we were running, no matter what, I'd always wake up with one
 hand in hers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that I noticed a lot of things in a row: 
\emph on
somebody
\emph default
 was holding me, carrying me someplace, but not Mama, or a vampire at all
 -- too warm, and with a heartbeat.
 By the light filtering through my eyelids, it was past sunrise; I'd slept
 late.
 I didn't feel injured, although I could have started that way and healed
 overnight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I opened my eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking down at me was a boy.
 He looked about sixteen or seventeen, and Native American with long hair
 tied back in a ponytail.
 
\emph on
Probably a wolf
\emph default
, was my first thought, but no -- in the sun, he was faintly glowing.
 Just like me.

 Sure, the last Mama heard was that Jacob's pack took Cody with them when
 they ran, but anything could have happened in that time, including the
 Volturi getting the third pack and Cody with them.

\begin_layout Standard
I tried to twist myself out of his grip but he held on.

 I yelled.
 I drew on my power to make it convey how scared I was.
 If he didn't want to hurt me, he might not want me to be scared either,
 and if he did want to hurt me, it wasn't going to get worse if he knew
 I was afraid.

I don't know what you know -- okay, there's good werewolves and bad werewolves,
 and I'm with the good wolves, and some bad wolves found you and that vampire
 you were with back there, and some good wolves and me were there too, and,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he huffed, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's kind of hard to deliver exposition and run at the same time, so can
 I maybe ask you to just trust me? We're seriously like five minutes from
 camp and it's safe to stop there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Cody said encouragingly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Food-food, or blood?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked.
 He'd been carrying me around for goodness only knew how long; he had to
 have figured out that I was a half-vampire.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I mean food-food.
 If you want blood you have to catch it yourself.
 You venomous?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

No.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wolves'll be able to share prey with you, then, if you drag them back to
 camp once they're dried up.
 I can't do that.
 Have to eat my own leftovers.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He winked at me.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Will you put me down, please? I'll come with you,

He tossed me into the air, and I was able to come down on my feet and keep
 up with him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Cody Clearwater.
 Look, I'm really 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 going to hurt you, and I'm already pretty sure you're Elspeth Cullen, but
 I'm trying to be friendly here instead of all creepy with the `I know who
 you are, wooo' crap.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And I knew who you were too.
 Wooo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He laughed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Up there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, pointing at a completely nondescript area of forest.
 I was pretty sure we were still in Iowa.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I followed him.
 He could have hurt me when I was knocked out, or asleep, or whichever I
 was, if he'd wanted.
 I'd need to go to New York eventually, but stopping for food and to get
 my bearings would probably help.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's nothing here, Cody,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How do you think we're still all alive, with the kept wolves running around?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera hides us.
 Pera! Pera, it's Cody and a friend!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he yelled at the apparently empty trees.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not just that I don't see anything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I also don't hear or smell anything.
 I haven't tripped over anybody, either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera's good,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he agreed, going a few feet forward to try again.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Problem is the hiding goes both ways.
 Except Pera herself, everybody she hides can only see other hidden people.
 So I have to get close to her in particular, not just any random person,
 and she doesn't have very good hearing.
 She might even still be asleep.
 
\emph on
Pera!
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody disappeared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I considered whether to run for it.
 I could go on to New York alone, maybe.
 After a minute's thought, I'd actually gone so far as to take two steps.
 If Pera's power would hide me from everyone and vice versa I'd 
\emph on
never
\emph default
 be able to find Mama until Pera let me go, and I wasn't sure I could trust
 her.
 But then Cody came back into existence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Welcome, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said a woman.
 She was standing right next to me, one hand out like she'd just touched
 my shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm Pera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She looked sleepy and Hispanic and in her late twenties, or early thirties.
 I saw a few tents set up that hadn't been there before, presumably hidden
 the same way, and heard snoring and breathing and heartbeats.
 Between two of the tents was a chocolate-furred wolf, lounging on the ground.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's...
 nice to meet you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said hesitantly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Um, can someone please tell me 
\emph on
what is going on?
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's safe here.
 Oh, and I promised food.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He tossed me a granola bar from out of a paper grocery bag that was hanging
 from a branch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I unwrapped it and ate.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My explanation?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, like I said, good wolves and bad wolves, where `good' means `don't want
 to eat your face' and `bad' means `might want to eat your face'.
 I've been calling the bad wolves `kept'.
 They work for the Volturi...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He trailed off.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Feel like telling me how much of the backstory you already know, so I can
 skip the parts that'll be repetitive?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will if you'll tell me what you already know about me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're Elspeth Cullen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody, rolling his eyes good-naturedly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your grandfather Charlie was a good friend of my parents before they died.
 Before 
\emph on
your
\emph default
 parents died, your mom was the one who activated the pack.
 She also turned my dad when my sister hurt him, delivered me when I came
 along, and forgot to warn anybody about a vampire from Alaska named Irina,
 who tipped off the Volturi about wolves existing when Becky's pack killed
 her mate.
 The Volturi showed up, Jake split off this pack and warned your mom, she
 and your dad showed up, Rachel and Becky and their packs had been completely
 brain-fried by a couple of the guard, and your parents both died.
 You were someplace else at the time, I'm going to guess your parents' coven,
 but who knows.
 And now, for some reason, you're in the middle of Iowa with a vampire --
 she a relative of yours maybe?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know who the Volturi are, I know how wolves work, I know about the twins'
 packs working for the Volturi, I know what happened to my parents,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I listed, not mentioning 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 I knew about Mama's status.
 I finished my granola bar and Cody threw me a bag of popcorn.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay.
 So, Pera here is Brady's girl,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said, pointing at Pera.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Brady was with Becky's pack, back before your parents and mine were killed,
 and he was a kept wolf for almost a month.
 We -- Jake's pack and imprints and me -- were on the run that entire time.
 We're pretty sure the only reason we didn't get killed or captured was
 that the Volturi figured they could take their time and get us later.
 But then they brought in Pera, 'cause they like collecting witches and
 she's one hell of a witch.

So,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he went on, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

before they could fry Pera's brain or turn her into a vampire, Brady laid
 eyes on her and poof, she's the center of his universe, you know how this
 works.
 Pera wants to 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 be fried or bit, so Brady defects packs, joins Jake's, and they get the
 hell out of Dodge.
 Where by `Dodge', I mean `Volterra'.
 They find us via telepathy and since then we've had it way easier, courtesy
 of Pera being excellent.

I was betrayed by someone who I had thought was a friend,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Pera said gravely.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I do not believe she could have captured me if I had been on my guard and
 had not trusted her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That part's a long story,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Later.
 Anyway, when we're hidden we can't see or talk to anybody who 
\emph on
isn't
\emph default
.
 Well, Pera can see everybody, but they can't see her when she hides.
 It can make a person kind of stir-crazy to have such a limited social circle.
 So sometimes Pera unhides a few of us because we don't want to start killing
 each other.
 Problem is that Demetri can tell 
\emph on
where
\emph default
 we are, and if anybody unhides while he's lurking with a pack of Volturi
 or kept wolves, we've got trouble.
 The good news is that they don't usually bother to stake us out, and they
 only use small teams for the purpose because they don't want to tie up
 large portions of the guard.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

But they were staking you out yesterday?

Looks that way,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Cody said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Me and Jake and Jared and Victor unhid to scope out the area and what should
 we find but a few kept wolves.
 They're the ones attacked you and your friend.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What happened to her?

 I demanded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody winced.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uh...
 by the time any of us got on the scene she was...
 already in bits and on fire.
 The kept wolves ran off all by themselves -- the smoke'll knock wolves
 out if they breathe it -- and Jake and Jared chased Demetri.
 Victor and I went after you because we could tell by the scent you were
 a halfsie and I wanted to see who you were, but when Victor caught up to
 you and nabbed you you 
\emph on
fainted
\emph default
, so we figured you were scared of wolves and he went to join up with Jake
 and Jared and I carried you this-a-way.
 Those three will be back any minute now -- Any news, Quil?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked the chocolate-furred wolf.
 The wolf, apparently Quil, shook his head.
 I supposed he was in wolf form to serve as a walkie-talkie.

Oh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 If everyone had run from the scene at the time Cody described, Mama was
 probably alive.
 Being on fire would hurt terribly, of course -- but she could live through
 it.
 She would meet me in Central Park.
 I just needed to go there.

I'm fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.

Marie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.
 Mama's middle name was her alias of choice only about a third of the time.
 But that was more often than any other single one.
 Jacob's pack -- and the imprints and Cody -- seemed to be against the Volturi.
 But that didn't mean I should tell all the secrets.

Pera said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Really, it is 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 early.
 I would like another few minutes of sleep before they return and I have
 to hide them too.
 Perhaps you could take your conversation elsewhere.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She went into one of the tents; Maureen zipped hers back up too, and it
 was just me and Cody and Quil and a lot of tents in the woods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Let's go for a walk and talk,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody suggested, and I followed him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So...
 explain Pera's power to me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The tents were hidden, but I saw the same trees before and after she hid
 me.
 So the 
\emph on
trees
\emph default
 couldn't be hidden.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wow, you go right for the tricky questions.
 I've lived with Pera most of my life and I barely understand how she works.
 Hmm...
 Okay, so you have the hiding place.
 That's where we are now.
 And you have outside, which is where we were before she hid us.
 Outside is where people normally receive their mail.
 Objects and plants and animals, on the other hand, usually exist both in
 the hiding place and outside, for some reason.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But the tents...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera can touch stuff to make it exist only in the hiding place, and that's
 what happened with the tents -- we didn't want someone stealing them or
 something.
 This also explains why we 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 tents, and food, and stuff.
 Sorry to inform you that you've fallen in with a pack of thieves.
 Pera just walks into places and hides whatever we want so we can walk out
 without it being noticed.
 If we pick things up without them being hidden first, people outside can
 see them floating -- disappearances are easier to time so nobody sees it
 happen.
 I mean, the Volturi can't get much more out for our blood than they already
 are, but there's no sense leaving collateral damage by letting bystanders
 see too much.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess that makes sense.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Hiding all the time like that would make it difficult to pursue any sort
 of gainful employment.
 I've never stolen anything and I don't think Mama has either, but she gave
 me explicit permission to mug humans for money or their phones or whatever
 I needed if I ran out of pocket money on the way to a rendezvous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You think so? It confuses the hell out of me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he laughed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyway.
 Pera can see, hear, and generally sense hidden things and outside things
 both, all the time, but she can only physically interact with stuff that's
 wherever she is.
 Except she can touch things in either place to hide or unhide them.
 She's hidden now, and she could hear me when I was unhidden.
 So I wandered around yelling `Pera, hey, Pera' until she woke up and poked
 me to hide me.
 Then I explained and she hid you too.
 You could walk into the nearest town and it'd be the spookiest thing you
 ever saw.
 Cars driving themselves and whatnot.

Are our clothes hidden?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked, looking down at myself.
 I was a little scruffy from all the flinging that had happened to me overnight.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

And are clothes on people outside invisible to hidden people?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Yeah.
 We're not sure why that happens.
 Anything that's really 
\emph on
on
\emph default
 your person, not just in your hand or whatever -- like something that would
 stay put if you went completely limp and were levitated into the air --
 will come with you when you hide or unhide, and isn't in both places like
 other stuff.

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Cody said frankly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera avoids that because she's pretty sure it couldn't be good.
 If I'm asking her to hide me, and she doesn't do it right away, I walk
 a few steps forward in case I'm intersecting something or somebody.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded.

I do need to go to New York,

 Mama would surely be long gone from where she'd fallen by now, on her way

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not 
\emph on
so
\emph default
 urgent that I have to go 
\emph on
right now
\emph default
, but I feel like I should be clear that I'm not...
 joining the pack, or anything.
 I really appreciate that you picked me up.
 I wouldn't have wanted to get gotten by the kept wolves.
 And it might make sense for me to hang out for a while if that's okay,
 at least until they and Demetri are gone.
 But -- eventually, as soon as it's safe, I need to go to New York.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I could put off setting out, if that would make the trip safer.
 Unlike me, Mama doesn't have a one-month limit on how long she's supposed
 to wait.
 She'll be worried if I take forever to get there, but she told me to take
 the safest route even if it's slower.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We move around a lot.
 Just to make it inconvenient for the Volturi and the kept wolves, so they
 have to haul out Demetri every time they want to know where we're at.
 And to avoid hitting places too hard with all the theft.
 I don't think anybody'd mind escorting you, as long as you're not in a
 hurry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Cody said, frowning.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't mean to give that impression.
 But we don't usually have any place in particular to go, so if you suggest
 one no one's liable to kick up a fuss.
 I'll just say, `Hey, Jake, let's take Elspeth to New York City where she
 needs to go' and he'll say `Sure, Cody, that sounds fine to me,' and then
 next time we break camp we'll go in that direction and so on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded slowly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So...
 this sounds like a fine plan to me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and Cody grinned broadly.
 His smile changed his whole face, like he had a very limited version of
 my power: he could communicate 
\emph on
I am happy
\emph default

 Traveling with the pack would certainly be easier and safer than trying
 to stretch the money in my pocket across half a dozen states.
 Mama would approve.
