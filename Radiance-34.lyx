\begin_layout Standard
Esme distributed phones, and Carlisle recited a litany of phone numbers
 for us to memorize: every phone-bearing person in Denali and everyone in
 Britain whose number Cath had provided.
 We didn't program the numbers into the phones in case they were somehow
 lost -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

it's not a terrible risk, but Siobhan thought that as long as we can just
 memorize the numbers, we should,

I did program Allirea's number into my phone, but I labeled it

 that way I would be able to actually

My Vicky, she knows me.
 She knows just what will strike my fancy.
 A neatly buttoned up loony bin, secure as can be, hard to get into and
 out of undetected...
 yet full of nibbles no one is likely to truly miss.
 Full of nutcases who were squirreled away here in the first place because
 their families didn't want them.
 The orderlies and the analysts and what all might be in a tizzy, but try
 getting the cops excited about a dead snack in a place like this.
 As long as my lunch is obviously a dead mental patient, not an escaped
 mental patient, they'll just pin it on another lunatic.
 Challenging hunt -- simple coverup.
 Ah, my Vicky, she gives such lovely presents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I smell two things, approaching the madhouse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
First, dinner -- lots of it, crowded in close and warm and only a little
 soured with bughouse drugs (my Vicky picked me an institution that prefers
 flavor-preserving treatments like electroshock, my lovely Vicky knows me)
 -- and one
\emph default
 dessert
\emph on
.
 I don't think she's one of those 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I've heard about, or not quite...but she does smell 
\emph default
delectable indeed
\emph on
.
 I've made up my mind to sink my teeth into whoever's leaving 
\emph default
that
\emph on
 trail the instant I breathe it in.
 There's no trail of her leading away from the place, so she's cracked,
 not a shrink or a nurse or anything of the kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Second, a vampire -- not me, and not Vicky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
And that scent is laid down
\emph default
 thick
\emph on
.
 This other vampire didn't just pop in here for breakfast and scurry off.
 This other vampire didn't just pass through the courtyard on his way to
 visit New Orleans and eat wayward Mardi Gras partiers.
 (Mm.) He's here every day.
 He's been here every day for a long time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What is a vampire doing here like the inedible trinket in a box of Cracker
 Jacks? As a patient he'd be found out right away.
 The Volturi would be on this place in a blink.
 Is he
\emph default
 working
\emph on
 here? Or maybe prowling around unofficially? I don't smell a hunt on the
 premises.
 He's not sneaking maniacs onto his plate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Is he going to get between me and my treat?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Wouldn't that be interesting?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I double back to my Vicky and thank her for the most fascinating present
 I have ever in my life received.
 Whatever the hell he's doing there, he's bound to give me an interesting
 time swiping my crazed confection off the dessert cart

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

I stake out the place around nightfall, hiding up in a tree, and watch personnel
 go in and out.
 The vampire hasn't been found out yet, so obviously he's on the night shift
 in this sunny weather.
 I spot him going up to the door, picking him out by gait first of everything.
 He's brazen as my Vicky showing off her shinies in the daylight to some
 morsel she's about to slurp up, but the humans aren't going to notice how
 nice and even he walks, how he smells like coconut and blood, how he's
 too pale and too pretty.
 Or they'll notice, but won't know what it means.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Nobody mentions his eye color when he goes in; they just call him 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dr.
 Carver
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, tell him good evening.
 Probably he's passed it off as some condition.
 Or he eats light, takes a couple days off, goes to work black-eyed.
 Didn't see him from that angle.
 But he works there.
 They know him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I wait.
 He comes out of the building again before dawn.
 (Red eyes.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
And he smells of my sweetmeat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
He doesn't
\emph default
 reek
\emph on
 of her, and the other kooks have rubbed off on him some too.
 I'm sure he didn't have her for supper.
 But he did spend more time with the morsel than with any of her fellow
 fruitcakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This is no pediatric psycho ward.
 If my nibble were his mate, he'd have turned her already, without fear
 of the Volturi and their vendetta against immortal children.
 If he were going to eat her...
 why wait? She's not the newest bat in the belfry, the smell of her hangs
 around this place too heavily for her to be recent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
He left himself a good hour between quitting time and sunrise.
 Once he's well away, I climb down my tree, slide some shoes on to look
 presentable, and go in to investigate.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Excuse me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

My name's James Carver.
 Is my brother here?

She flutters her eyelashes at me.
 Vicky'd probably kill her for that if Vicky were here, but she's not.

Dr.
 Carver is your brother? I don't believe he's mentioned you.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shucks!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I'm just toying with her now, playing my role.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was going to meet him here! He was talking about his patient in his last
 letter -- been talking about her for some time now, but I've just got no
 memory for names, can't quite recall what he called her, might have had
 an E in it? -- anyway he thought she was an interesting case study.
 I'm working on a book,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I add.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

There any chance I could meet Miss Brandon now rather than waiting 'till
 my brother's back tomorrow? Only my wife's not well, I'd have stayed with
 her if I hadn't had this trip planned so long but she didn't want me to
 jeopardize my book to fuss over her, and I'd like to make all my observations
 quick and get home to her.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll just be in and out, lickety-split,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I promise.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't need to interview Miss Brandon tonight or even wake her up if she's
 sleeping.
 Just have to get a first impression of her to introduce her case in the
 book.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And in fact I don't plan to eat 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Miss Brandon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 right now.
 That would be too easy, and too obvious to the people who look out for
 this sort of thing.
 But I do intend to learn where her room is, and leave a trail of my own
 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dr.
 Carver
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to find.
 Let him make this interesting.
 I don't know why he's so interested in Miss Brandon if he's not going to
 eat her and she's not his mate, but maybe he'll make me work for my dessert.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She fumbles her fingers through her hair, which they've shorn very short,
 probably to make her easier to wash.
 She sounds lucid, for a loon.
 And the statement about me is quite uncanny.
 But she might be a paranoid who thinks everyone wants to kill her.

Even when we can

Exactly.
 Now, the tricky part is getting ahold of Alice and her mate in such a way
 that you can deprogram them and we can give her a relative to latch onto
 so she doesn't stick with the Volturi out of inertia -- but the

easy

 Alice up and see who there might be.

My head was spinning.
 The 
\emph on
usual
\emph default
 means by which the Volturi shed guards was death (like Demetri) or the
 discovery of a mate (like Eleazar).
 But on a handful of occasions, guards had learned that they had a child
 or grandchild or sibling unbeknownst to them, and -- presented with a family
 that Marcus couldn't see coming and Chelsea couldn't have taken from them
 -- decided to depart.
 Losing a particularly valuable witch this way (who'd abandoned the guard
 to be with his son, depriving the Volturi of his invisibility power) in
 1602 had been the last straw for Caius, who'd called for more stringent
 relative-finding procedures -- partly to check for heritable witchcraft,
 and partly to kill or controllably snip away stray kin.

They had not bothered with this for witches in their dungeon.

\begin_layout Standard
Alice's own memories provided no significant clue to where she'd come from
 -- when she retraced her steps a couple of years after turning, to figure
 out where she'd been created, she'd found the place, all right -- hundreds

 Dr.
 Carver had moved her there, trying to buy her time in their escape from
 James.

My mother had later told her what James had said, but he hadn't named the

 1920 and 1929.
 I peeked, and noted that when my mother had begun explaining all of this
 information, Alice had actually balked at the implied tedium before even
 learning that 
\emph on
James
\emph default
 had been the source of the information.
 She'd never followed up later, either.
 It was a reasonable guess, but not one she'd bothered to make.

\begin_layout Standard
Aro had 
\emph on
James's

 But Aro had no reason to think James and Alice were connected.
 He'd only read the tracker to determine whether he was witch enough to
 bring into the guard, troublesome enough to kill.
 He'd relied on Santiago's memories about what James had said to apprehend
 the basic situation between the tracker and his captive...
 he'd chosen to read James merely to determine the nature of his witchcraft...
 he couldn't read my mother, from whom I'd heard the story...
 He certainly 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 be able to figure out whence Alice by idly browsing through James's exploits
 of a century previous, but with so much else to look at, he wasn't likely
 to find the information that way.

 I explained what my mother's power had shown her and how we'd determined

Eve is the only wolf who ever actually

 she had three bites, not one.

 Do you think I can send

Allirea

 comes back instead of running to her father and sisters, or her kids, or
 just off by herself where nobody can look at her.
 Do you have another half-vampire or werewolf up your sleeve? Can you suggest
 another person who will be able to explain to Alice's granddaughter or
 nephew or whoever you find this entire mess, believably, and get him or
 her to travel to Alaska to participate in the next step?

 Any preferences?

The non-witch part ruled out my mother, so I didn't waste time feeling guilty
 about finding the idea of bringing her awkward.
 I considered my grandparents, but decided Carlisle was probably an important
 rallying point for most of the local allies and shouldn't be running hither
 and yon.
 Especially the Denalis, who I decided against promptly -- I didn't know
 how sure to be of their changed loyalties.
 I considered Kachiri and Senna, who I remembered through their captured
 sister Zafrina's eyes.
 I considered Carlisle's various friends who I remembered through his history.
 I spent all of two seconds considering Cath and Ilario.
