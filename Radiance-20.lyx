That was my grandfather Carlisle's voice.
 It took me a moment to identify it because it was how he sounds to himself,

 human Esme, I realized.
 I know this story -

 That was my grandma, telling me something, when I was four months old.

 God above, she's dying, they're taking her to the

 No, they're right.
 They can't save her.

 I could build this car from scratch if I wanted to.
 I know enough about how it works that I could take scrap metal and make
 a car.
 Not

 I can never make a little happy child who will play in the front yard and

 I'm so 
\emph default
sure
\emph on
 we can fly, 
\emph default
really
\emph on
 fly.
 That's one power I've never found.
 No telekinetic or gravity-tweaker or other miscellaneous witch can really,
 truly fly, but maybe Benjamin can manage it, and if he can, so can I.
 He laughs -- I think he may be having as much fun as I am -- and collects
 the air and jumps, but we must still be missing something.
 He can throw himself through the air for significant distances, and it
 
\emph default
is
\emph on
 better than jumping.
 But he can't finely control that much air.
 He's catapulting himself, whipping up a wall of wind to push and then having
 to let it go when it gets big enough for the job.
 He's not flying.
 I want us to fly.
 I gather some air of my own; it could still be a matter of focus or creativity,
 not of a fundamental growth in the power...

Gianna Trafeli, sir,

 I tell him.
 Is he a vampire, really, truly a vampire? That's what I was looking for,
 but it's so strange to have found it! And...
 and rather terrifying...
 but my brother needs help and there's only so much the doctors can do -
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't remember much -- or rather I don't 
\emph on
personally
\emph default
 remember much -- about Gianna.
 You could count the number of times I saw her on one hand, although I guess
 I spent a few weeks I can't remember in very close quarters with her.
 But the first twenty-three years of her life were just -- there, if I wanted
 them and even if I didn't.
 Just as easily called to mind as anything that ever happened to me, except
 for the part where she was human the last time Aro read her and had forgotten
 a lot.
 
\end_layout

Well, a ways up the road and around the corner; the car is stolen, you see,

 Wake your Jacob and we can be on our way.

 my Jasper snarls.
 Really? Well, of course really -- but why would a Quileute be calling Bella?
 That 
\emph default
is
\emph on
 what the name means, isn't it, that was the surname of the alpha family?
 Or it's a coincidence -- or -- oh no -- did she -- Edward's noticed something
 he doesn't like about my mate's thoughts, and he's standing between my
 Jasper and his Bella.
 But I don't understand yet what's going on, I can't see, Elspeth's in the
 way over there and something else is blocking me too, I can't 
\emph default
see -

Nnng,

Elspeth! Are you okay?

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I think so?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I murmured.

The memories are still -- popping up -- but I can...
 be here, too, if that makes sense.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Good,

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Let's be on our way, shall we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She got out of the car, and Jake picked me up and followed her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The fellow who gave me this address indicated that Maggie, Gianna, and Ilario
 all live together at number 220 up ahead.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Maggie exclaims, and Bella obviously doesn't know quite what to think.
 Well, not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obviously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not by my standards, but she's waiting, watchfully, as the situation unfolds,
 and doesn't answer the Irish visitor when she speaks again: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll take good care of her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I wish I 
\emph default
knew
\emph on
 what Bella was thinking, I wish I could read her -- but no, I shouldn't
 wish for that, not when she doesn't -

\begin_layout Standard
Jake carried me almost half a block while I processed that memory.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What was it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked, when I pulled out of it and blinked and looked around.

\begin_layout Standard

Also potentially awkward.

Ugh! Ugh!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 But there was no getting rid of it.
 It was already there before he mentioned it, I just hadn't consciously
 processed it.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ugh.
 Just

 Quick, ask me about something else so I can deal with a totally unrelated

Miklos isn't back yet.
 He said a quick lunch.
 Why is it I don't just turn all the witches I find, so they won't need
 to take so many breaks? Yes, yes, low profile, and I don't care very much
 if they go on to die of old age after I'm through with them.
 Some of them might get greater powers as vampires, but most of them wouldn't,
 or if they did it would only be a case of thinking faster and they wouldn't
 surpass me with the copied version.
 And anyway, I'm not interested in babysitting newborns for a year until
 they can focus on things more complicated than blood.
 Such as, of course, magic.
 More efficient to learn what I can from Miklos, teach what I can, bid him
 goodbye, and find my next pupil -

It was a cute house, nestled snugly between two others and painted white
 with flower-filled window boxes in front of each firmly closed pair of
 curtains.
 It looked as quiet in the pre-dawn darkness as its neighbors, but if vampires
 really lived here, they certainly weren't asleep.

My knuckles had barely touched it when the handle turned and the door swung
 open.
 There stood Gianna.

She was quite tall, and looked down at me with a polite, distant expression
 in her black-edged golden eyes.

Come, come.
 All of you.
 But if

 she added, pointing a stern finger at Addy, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph default
 harming my daughter, I will kill you.
 My mate will be able to confirm whether you have thought about doing so

 I recommend that you avoid it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Daughter? She didn't mean me, did she...? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's the heartbeat upstairs?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inquired Addy.
 I listened for that, and heard it -- a human's heart, slow compared to
 mine -- and realized that Gianna must have somehow had or adopted a daughter
 of her own recently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Relax.
 There is so much prey in the world 
\emph on
without
\emph default
 guardians; it's not my sort of entertainment to go after the better-protected
 kind.

\begin_layout Standard
Gianna nodded once, clenching her jaw, and we went inside with her.
 Maggie and Ilario were at the foot of the staircase, and looked on as we
 filed in.
 Jake appeared to take in the uniformly gold eyes, but seemed edgy anyway
 and put his hand on my shoulder protectively.

I opened my mouth, but Addy was creeping towards Maggie, licking her lips.
 Maggie backed up, edgily.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I won't hurt you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, and it was true, and this seemed to impress Maggie more than
 it would have affected anyone else.
 She stayed put, and Addy got close enough to touch Maggie's arm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Mmm.

Addy, you know what's happened over the last day and I don't, could you

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy nodded, took one moment to add her memory of my incoherent reverie
 to my massive collection, and then -- to judge by their facial expressions
 -- sent a summary to the three other vampires.
 Maggie had a pleased look on her face, like she was viewing unusually attractiv

 boost my power gave it was nice for her.

I like this place.
 It's remote -- less temptation.
 I do agree with my sisters that it's about time we stopped killing the

 There's lots of wildlife here, and I suppose we can stay as long as we

No,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Anyway, to answer you, we have a child.
 A young, human, extremely vulnerable child.

I did some genealogical poking around.
 This is all on the theory that my sister-in-law didn't cuckold my brother,
