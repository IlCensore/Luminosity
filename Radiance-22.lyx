\begin_layout Chapter
Planner
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maggie parked us in an underground lot.
 It was quite sunny out in Dublin, so rather than climb the stairs to the
 street and find Siobhan and Liam, she phoned and told them where to find
 us.
 We all got out of the car, and I kept a restraining hand on Jake's elbow,
 not wanting him to start a fight even if it would probably come out in
 our favor.
 I had no suction-device, and a lucky bite could kill him even if Addy lost.
 He looked daggers at her, but she stayed a respectful distance back and
 he didn't phase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can't go wolf anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 muttered Jake, leaning down to speak in my ear, although all the vampires
 could certainly hear him anyway.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I still have a pack, and any of them are wolves at the time, they'll
 hear me thinking and I know where I am.
 Don't want to make it easy for them to report that we're in Dublin.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We waited for a couple of minutes, trying to look casual to the gazes of
 humans who passed through the garage to retrieve their cars or drove in
 to park.
 A couple of them looked twice at us -- we made an odd group -- but no one
 tried to interact with us.
 Addy kept her eyes closed in case anyone was capable of discerning their
 color in the dim fluorescence from a few yards away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan and Liam came down the stairs into the lot.
 I recognized them at once, from Carlisle's memories and my father's.
 For a moment I thought those were the only people whose memories I had
 who'd ever seen Siobhan and Liam, but that wasn't quite true -- Aro had
 gone to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a Scottish vampire from Liam's former coven, and read him and then had
 him executed upon determining that he wasn't useful enough to keep around
 or safe to let free.
 That vampire contained the only memories I had of Siobhan and Liam 
\shape italic
fighting
\shape default
, all out, not just sparring for practice or scuffling for dominance.
 Liam was okay at it.
 Siobhan was terrifyingly powerful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tried, but I had no way to figure out whether Aro had ever accessed any
 of the memories available to him about the Irish vampires.
 He hadn't dwelled on them, or there would have been at least a minute or
 two of memories of him 
\shape italic
planning
\shape default
 or 
\shape italic
musing
\shape default
 or something; but he could have thought about them, had no special reaction,
 and not put down anything I could remember beyond the copied memories themselve
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, seeming to aim the greeting mostly at Maggie.
 Addy was looking at the huge woman with a fascinated, almost hungry expression.
 Siobhan glanced at Addy, then held out her hand to shake her former covenmate's
, and Maggie moved to clasp it.
 Before they touched, Addy darted forward to seize Siobhan by the wrist
 and then spring away.
 She was out of the parking lot and up the stairs in a fraction of a second.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought I heard her cackling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan began.
 Ilario chased Addy into the stairwell, and Maggie sprinted after them,
 muttering something I didn't quite catch that might or might not have been
 family-friendly, plus a warning to her brother-in-law about sticking to
 the shade.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What was that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Liam, looking edgy, like he was considering running after the others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy copies witch powers by touching the people who have them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She...
 here, I'll show you, if that's okay
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I started composing a summary in my head.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Show us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Siobhan.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and that got a stunned reaction from both of the pair, but sufficed
 to explain what I was talking about, at least.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's faster my way, if you don't mind
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why don't you 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

show
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 me first, then we'll see about Siobhan,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suggested Liam, suspicious.
 Jacob shifted his weight behind me, and when I glanced up, he was locking
 eyes with the other man, not quite hostile, but implacably announcing allegianc
e.
 Liam looked back at him with a distasteful frown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I acquiesced, and a few moments later Liam frowned and nodded, and Siobhan
 made a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

get on with it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gesture and I gave her the summary as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just after that had been sent along, Ilario and Maggie jogged back down
 the stairs.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She jumped off the quay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 snarled Maggie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nobody saw her do it, but that's where her scent ended.
 And once we started 
\shape italic
asking
\shape default
 if anyone had seen a lady fling herself into the river, of course, 
\shape italic
we
\shape default
 had so much attention that there's no way we could have tried to follow
 her at any speed without getting noticed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't even 
\shape italic
have
\shape default
 a power,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think you must,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy must have tasted it.
 If she hadn't I think she would have stuck with us and said she was just
 checking.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How could I not have 
\shape italic
noticed
\shape default
 being a witch?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

People -- your grandfather mostly -- have been insisting that I am for hundreds
 of years, but don't you think 
\shape italic
I
\shape default
 would be able to tell?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shook my head; Memory supplied me with a few cases of witches Addy had
 met who hadn't been aware of their powers, and I was dimly aware of the
 availability of more examples if I wanted them.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Some powers don't feel like anything, or usually don't.
 Mine usually doesn't.
 A lot of witches don't know what they are, or think it's a non-magical
 knack or something.
 I'm sure Eleazar could have told you if you'd ever met him, but you didn't.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My word,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd like to get out of this car park,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Maggie, glancing at a passing human family on their way to their minivan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't seem the best place to talk.
 Siobhan, is that old hotel still...?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can we all fit into the car?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll sit on Jake,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and with that, and Ilario moving to the middle of the backseat
 so Siobhan -- a hair taller than even Jake -- could ride shotgun, we managed
 to squeeze in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's very odd,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Liam.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have a lot of questions, but as soon as I think of them clearly enough
 that I could ask, I realize I already know the answer.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elsie's handy like that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jake proudly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So...
 Where are we going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Abandoned hotel,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Maggie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nice place to hide out in while a vampire in Dublin.
 Out of the way, lots of big shade trees 'round it, collects squatters nobody's
 going to miss, so -- uh
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there any chance the squatters could be allowed to live today?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked solemnly.
 Siobhan and Liam's eyes were darkened, but not black.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If it matters that much, I suppose,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, shrugging.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can climb in through the back to the part above the wrecked staircase;
 there's never any humans in that section.
 Liam and I 
\shape italic
do
\shape default
 need to eat, though, so you can only make so many requests that we put
 it off before we ignore you; do you want to spend one on the folks camping
 out in the hotel?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I kept silent, and Siobhan turned her head to look at me appraisingly.
 Liam sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you inherit the moralizing from -- well, I guess Carlisle's not your
 
\shape italic
biological
\shape default
 grandfather and Edward never seemed to think he had the high ground on
 the subject -- or from your mam, maybe? She managed to convert Maggie,
 rather more effective than Carlisle...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think it's the sort of thing I particularly had to inherit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said softly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I went back in time and asked your parents they probably wouldn't be
 in favor of eating people, would they?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

S'pose not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Liam negligently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are we having hobo for lunch or not, dear?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He addressed Siobhan with that comment, and she looked at me again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If not them, who?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I wondered, not making eye contact.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you pick?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Generally depends on who'll go missing with the least fuss,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Liam said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyone who's already lost or cut off from other folks -- or dying, occasionally
 there's a good accident or some of the less repulsive diseases.
 Got to lie low, you see.
 Haven't a stable address and a legal identity like Maggie and company have
 got themselves, mustn't make anyone too curious.
 Oh, and mustn't form a pattern.
 Can't kill half a dozen streetwalkers in a row with the same hair color
 or initials or what have you within spitting distance of a single city,
 or they start babbling about serial killers and then everyone gets very
 excited.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You are serial killers,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I pointed out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I suppose,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Liam said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but we're not the human sort.
 Not trying to rid the world of some particular type, or bitter about our
 childhoods, or whatever it is that motivates that lot.
 Just thirsty.
 Oh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and people on drugs are not so toothsome.
 We avoid those when it's convenient.
 Usually can tell by smell.
 That's all I can think of for in general; other than that we could nosh
 on anybody.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a silence, and Siobhan announced, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll clear out the hotel the usual way, Liam.
 All else being equal it would be best not to do anything this complicated
 on an empty stomach.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
***
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ilario, Jake, and I followed Maggie into the upper stories of the hotel
 through the back way Siobhan had mentioned.
 Siobhan and Liam went in through the front.
 I covered my ears and asked Memory to give me something loud, and spent
 the minutes we waited remembering a metal concert that Heidi had once attended.
 (She had later encouraged some of the audience to follow her into the bus
 she used to bring prey back to Volterra, but I concentrated on the music.)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan and Liam climbed up the elevator shaft and joined us after a short
 while, eyes newly bright.
 Jake squeezed my hand, which 
\shape italic
was
\shape default
 comforting, but I felt...
 almost unwilling to be comforted.
 Like I should have said something clever or done something heroic, such
 that I wouldn't need it, so if I needed it, that was because I'd failed.
 I didn't pull my hand away, in case Jake was the one who needed it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, pacing around the hotel room.
 It was breezy from the broken window we'd come through, and everything
 inside was moldy and water damaged and faded beige and blue.
 Jake seemed uncomfortable, and kept prodding the half-collapsed bed with
 his foot as though he thought it might become a suitable place to sit given
 enough kicks, but the vampires and I were all reasonably comfortable standing.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, is there anything pertinent left out of your summary?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't 
\shape italic
think
\shape default
 so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I don't know what might be pertinent.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

People,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

players or potential players in the field, their resources, their abilities,
 their skills, their motives, their needs, their personalities, what will
 and won't surprise them.
 Constraints on what we can do, places we can go, that sort of thing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I spent the next couple of hours listing and describing every person in
 the Volturi guard and what I could remember on my own or from the blast
 about the allies my relatives were accumulating in Denali.
 Intermittently I'd pause to answer Siobhan's occasional clarifying questions
 -- everything from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how willing is Vasanti to send the animals she possesses into danger?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do you see any patterns Adelaide didn't in Pyotr's compulsion?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in a toe-to-toe physical fight, is Renata actually any good without her
 power?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Depends on if the animal is a long-term pet or not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told her about the Indian witch.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know what she's gotten since she was let out of the dungeon, but
 in the past she's usually kept some birds and rats and other random animals
 that she's gotten attached to around all the time, and those she likes
 to keep safe if it's convenient.
 Others she doesn't care -- she'll make mice feed themselves to her other
 pets, sometimes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I concluded after a long search through Pyotr's memories, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it seems just about random.
 Sometimes it'll work on a person and then not, sometimes it'll work for
 a specific command and then not, I don't see any connection to time of
 day or location or whether he says it with a different accent or even anything
 he's thinking about when he gives the order.
 It does only work when he means for it to, so he doesn't compel people
 by accident, at least.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked me if I had memories for anybody he'd bossed around before,
 and I shook my head; he hadn't been one of Addy's original pupils and spent
 his entire time in Volterra in pieces unable to talk to anyone.
 When Addy had borrowed his power she'd avoided using it against any of
 the Volturi, so I didn't have information from that end about how it worked
 in her hands either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hard to say, but I don't think so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said of Renata's fighting capabilities.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She can't turn her shield off, so nobody's ever actually been able to attack
 her.
 She can hit people who can't hit back just fine.
 I think she'd be confused by someone who could go after her without getting
 turned away.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were more questions.
 I consulted Memory to get her to sift through what I knew and extract short
 answers from long life stories.
 Siobhan asked about things I never would have considered even slightly
 relevant -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how many teeth on that saw?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (thirty), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what part of New Zealand is Emere from?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (near what's since become Christchurch) -- along with likely useful things
 -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

does Jane have any direct combat ability?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (almost none), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where do you think your mother is?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, regarding my mother.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think she ever actually arrived in Denali.
 If she did, Addy never heard about it, and she spent a lot of downtime
 with my father's power and would have probably noticed -- from him if nobody
 else -- if someone was thinking they'd found her.
 But she 
\shape italic
was
\shape default
 heading there when Alice saw her, and I don't think Alice lied.
 My father would have noticed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So somehow,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Maggie, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bella changed her mind -- knew 
\shape italic
to
\shape default
 change her mind -- and turned around instead of going to Denali, but where
 would she go?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or she got there and knew what was going on before anyone noticed her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jake.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Smelled the field team, maybe, if she came in from the right direction at
 the right time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sounds plausible,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, nodding in Jake's direction without quite looking at him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But while Bella is 
\shape italic
currently
\shape default

I don't know.
 She might have gone to Volterra looking for me but she had long enough

 I guess she could be in San Francisco waiting to see if I make it there

 in Denali.

I...
 I don't know.
 She's turned someone before to save his life.
 I don't know if she'd do it to attack Volterra.
 Especially since she probably doesn't know my father's alive.
 But she might be doing something like that if she can find volunteers.
 She

 Her dad knows about stuff and her mom and stepdad don't, or didn't.

We still get on -- less since Molly, but still.
 Calls Swindon her own, has to at least be on speaking terms with the Bristol

The Makah tribe, or at least the families of the Makahs who live in the

 Jake frowned, and she shrugged.

Or not if needn't be.

Caius didn't stop hunting them until he was as positive they were gone as

He

 Even if there was one like that back when the hunt was on, it would be
 dead by now -- it would either have bitten people and they would have made
 themselves obvious or it wouldn't have and they'd have died out that way.
 There's been no sign of them.

She's got a few dozen old friends, all around the world, with powers minor

 She might be looking for one of them,

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

If we could get hold of David so they didn't have to worry about him, and

 Then it would be safe to talk to the other people who are in Denali with
 them now.
 Also I think David would help.

 I leaned my face on my hand to ask Memory if I knew anything.
 Addy had heard the news: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

They're alive.
 In Nashville.
 The Volturi decided they weren't a threat and let them go home.
 They

The other wolves -- and the imprints and the puppies -- get visits from
 Chelsea nearly every day,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Jake,

but take that away and wolves'd be natural enemies with vampires.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He glanced around at the vampires who were all looking at him quizzically,
 since he was a wolf and standing right there and not attacking them.
 He sputtered for a moment and went on.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, 
\shape italic
I'm
\shape default
 with Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he clarified.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I go where she goes.
 If she goes and hangs out with vampires so do I.
 Other wolves could work with specific vampires too.
 Rachel and Bella were pals for a while.
 But I mean that it might be possible to get the packs aimed at the Volturi.
 Who are vampires.
 And who most of the wolves have no non-Chelsea reason to like.
 What I'm saying is if you put a wolf and a vampire in a room together and
 there aren't special circumstances going on there's going to be a fight,
 and we know what the special circumstances are there and maybe could get
 rid of them.

You are so lucky to have such a formidable intellect in your corner, Elspeth.

Here's a thought,

Hm,
