\begin_layout Chapter
Resurrector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother couldn't give a verdict on Harry and Sue Clearwater's resurrection
 immediately.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We don't know what the families of the three men are going to do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said gently, as though it were me she was threatening to disappoint
 and not Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not 
\emph on
sure
\emph default
 whether resurrecting Sue without Harry would be a terribly cruel thing
 to do or not, given that she'd show up in a human body without a mate bond
 like Didyme, but it's not an experiment I'm prepared to authorize,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she continued.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

However, if -- 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 -- one of the men is available, I don't have my heart set on any other
 females who meet the criteria the way Sue does...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy raised her hand, rather than interrupting, and my mother glanced in
 her direction.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she inquired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

May I suggest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that you wait on deciding what to do with donated bodies until Didyme is
 turned and you learn whether or not she's going to...
 regain...
 her witchcraft?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother was silent for a moment, and then asked quietly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you have anyone in mind?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, Aro wasn't in the habit of letting powerful witches who crossed his
 path die...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy languidly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aro himself,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my dad muttered, his face close to my mom's ear.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Didyme and Aro both gained powers only after they turned.
 If she has the same one after she's had her eggs out and changed again,
 then her brother...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I hadn't been aware that Didyme was having eggs extracted.
 I supposed Marcus wouldn't like her to take the risk of bearing a half-vampire
 herself and wanted her turned as soon as possible anyway.
 They might or might not want children, and could use the extra time to
 decide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We just went to a great deal of trouble to 
\emph on
kill
\emph default
 Aro,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother pointed out testily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To kill Aro at age twenty-three centuries and change,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy corrected.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If he can be brought back, he can only be brought back at age human-years-plus-o
ne-point-four-seconds, because that's the amount of time he had alive before
 he first touched someone and got a dose of life history, putting way too
 much in his head to stay put in a human.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Still too dangerous,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my father murmured.
 My mother was quiet, waiting for Addy to complete her argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Siobhan said that vampire personalities are fixed...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I recalled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He wouldn't remember everything else, at least not until he touched someone
 who'd been blasted, but he'd still be the same person.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, shrugging with an innocent smile.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So you 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 be bringing back a sociopath with an annoying propensity for calling people
 by endearments, because that is Aro's personality.
 But Elspeth, Edward, 
\emph on
look
\emph default
 at his early development.
 You know it as well as I do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caius had turned Aro, while Athenodora looked on, on what amounted to a
 whim.
 They were looking for witches, and, having found no human ones, had taken
 to turning people nearly at random to see if they developed powers.
 Some they'd been disappointed by and sent to live on their own, some they'd
 been disappointed by and killed.
 They'd found Marcus first and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kept
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 him when he turned up talented, and then Aro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aro as a human, in the misty memories he'd retained from his own perspective
 and the sharply recorded ones of his covenmates' observations, had been
 acquisitive and sociopathic and self-interested and had used his uncommon
 (if nonmagical) insight about people to become too familiar with them and
 manipulate them as called for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had not been particularly interested in politics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He'd adopted Caius's project of taking over the world for himself, pursuing
 it with a certain singlemindedness that, in conjunction with the nature
 of his power, had ultimately led to his taking the central role in the
 coven.
 Caius hadn't intended to create his own leader, but didn't have Aro's drive,
 and let it happen over the first half-century of Aro's vampire life without
 much fuss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One point four seconds after he'd turned, before he'd first grabbed and
 eaten the humans that Caius and Athenodora and Marcus had left for him,
 Aro had not been unusually inclined to take over the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My father was whispering a breakdown of this information into my mother's
 ear.
 She was frowning.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Be all that as it may,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said when he'd finished, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't think of any clever way to ensure that he never touches someone
 who was in the blast and catches up, as it were.
 Especially you, Addy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was just a thought,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, and she turned around, poked Razi in the shoulder, and waited
 for Nathan to send her on her next errand abroad.
 Nathan pointed her to a set of coordinates somewhere in the Philippines
 and she was off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother leaned to the left, crooked her wrist around my neck, and drew
 me in close.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When I'm not shielding you, can you remember anything Aro read from Allirea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked in an undertone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I blinked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, I never think to, even when it would be relevant.
 Um, where is she, anyway? Wasn't she guarding you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She agreed to stick around long enough that you could tell everyone honestly
 that there was an inexplicable reason no one ought to attack me, and now
 she's visiting her family.
 She'll join up with us in a couple of weeks.
 In your opinion,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if you blasted Allirea, and then Aro read her 
\emph on
while she was faded
\emph default
 before reading anyone else in his reincarnation, how would that affect
 his ability to remember the other contents of the read?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I blinked rapidly, thinking.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He automatically filtered out redundancies, so he wouldn't copy those same
 things again if he touched someone else who had them.
 And if he got them from Allirea, then he might ignore them the way he'd
 ignore her own memories no matter where they came from.
 But Allirea unfades sometimes -- like, I'm sure she's not 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 lurking about her kids' houses and watching them, right? She'd unfade to
 say hi.
 I often don't think about her even when she's unfaded when she's not around
 because I don't usually have a reason to.
 But for a reincarnated Aro, to suddenly be able to access all of those
 memories would be noticeable, I think.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Standing a ways back, Jake and Iris were looking politely confused about
 what I was talking about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Occasionally, she does, yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother acknowledged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And short of me accompanying her to shield her relatives every time she
 wants to visit them, there's no obvious way around that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She pulled her lower lip between her teeth, thoughtful.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I may think of something else before we need to make a decision.
 I'm not sold on the idea to the point where if we wind up with only one
 male patient to spare I'd refuse to bring back the Clearwaters, at any
 rate.
 Especially since we'd be so likely to have to kill Aro 
\emph on
again
\emph default
 even if everything worked as well as could possibly be hoped.
 And that would not be the happiest ending I could think of to the story
 of the blast victims.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So if one of the guys' families says we can reincarnate someone with their
 relative, I can try to bring back Cody's parents?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother thought, still worrying her lip between her teeth, and then nodded
 once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On impulse, I spun towards her and gave her a hug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wouldn't have noticed the hesitation if I hadn't thought to look for it,
 but after a stunned pause, her arms closed around me and she squeezed me
 back.
 It didn't occur to me to be uneasy about it until we'd been standing like
 that for more than a couple of seconds, at which point I decided that being
 uneasy about it would be silly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said suddenly, sounding enthralled, like she'd just opened her eyes
 to see some stunning scenery.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Say something.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset space ~

Something?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

State something,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she revised, a touch of strain in her voice for some reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will be six in October,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I tried, not sure what she was getting at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She hugged me tighter.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I did it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she murmured in my ear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What did you do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I let you in.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Through your shield?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, and she released me from the hug to put her hands on my shoulders,
 look me in the eye, and nod.
 She was grinning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just for a couple of seconds,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and now I've lost it -- it takes concentration, even more than shielding
 another person, but I did it...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She let me go, and leaned back to tuck her head under my father's chin.
 She scrunched her eyes shut in focus, obviously clenching her teeth, and
 after a moment, my father's face lit up in indescribable wonder.
 Almost too fast for me to follow, he seized her, dipped her low to the
 floor, and gave her a kiss that prompted some very discomfiting memories
 to stir up in my head.
 I looked at the ceiling, until my mother breathlessly laughed, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't concentrate enough to relax the shield if you're going to do that,
 Edward...
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I 
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he enthused, purring at her, and she straightened up and entwined her fingers
 behind his neck, replying in kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Addy is going to go out of her mind when she finds out,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I predicted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mom said smugly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is going to have to work very, very hard to make me trust her enough that
 it becomes even 
\emph on
theoretically possible
\emph default
 for me to let her through my inner shield to have that oh-so-disturbing
 `taste' she wants.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I laughed, and my mom pulled me in for another hug and my dad's arm went
 around my shoulders too, and for a few moments I was purely content.

\begin_layout Standard
Benito's six-year-old son was surprisingly easy to explain things to.
 He came in with his grandfather (Benito's dad) and aunt (Benito's sister).
 Benito's ex-wife was remarried to a fellow from France and had not brought
 her child with her when she moved abroad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The little boy's name was Nino, and he overwhelmed his shocked grandpa and
 skeptical aunt with unreasonable enthusiasm about vampires and werewolves
 and the fact that I was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a real live 
\emph on
magical princess
\emph default
 for 
\emph on
real
\emph default
".
 He didn't seem to understand that his father had been supplanted.
 I told him, but the concept was over his head and my power didn't fill
 the gap.
 Instead, Nino seemed to react to John like he was an act his father was
 putting on, who used a translator out of a desire to stay in character.
 Nino cheerfully demanded stories about John's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adventures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forever ago
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when he was a vampire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
John was not immune to the charms of small children, or he wouldn't have
 kept a close enough eye on his daughter Anne to know that she was sick,
 let alone turned her.
 He related moderately-fictionalized versions of his life a millenium previous,
 which wound up taking up most of the meeting with the family.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy discreetly extracted practical information from the relatives.
 The grandfather was retired, but able enough for sixty-seven, and could
 look after Nino indefinitely given financial support.
 (If Nino's mother didn't take the opportunity to change her mind about
 wanting to bring the child to France, which possibility the sister openly
 derided as less likely than the existence of vampires.) John himself was
 still inclined to be turned into a vampire 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

again
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in spite of the new laws surrounding the consumption of humans as food
 products.
 Even if he adjusted immediately to the challenge of being around human-type
 people he wasn't allowed to eat, he didn't yet have the comprehension of
 the modern world to get along with and attempt to bring up 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

his
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 son in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But you can still write me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Nino said when it was explained that John was probably going to travel
 the world with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

magical princess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

friends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in order to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

learn to be a vampire again".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, I can do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 John said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In Italian, even, once I'm turned and can easily learn the language, er,
 again.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Nino with a conspiratorial wink, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you have to learn it again so the magic princess can do magic princess stuff
 instead of saying what you say!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wondered how old Nino would be before it hit him that this wasn't a grand
 game his dad was playing, but for the time being I was just grateful that
 he wasn't devastated.
 The grandfather had been looking after Nino while his father was in the
 hospital anyway.
 It would require a little legal maneuvering that we could delegate to Santiago
 for Benito's disappearance to be officially explained and custody officially
 transferred, was all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subsequent day, the family of the brothers called in with their decision.
 The married brother's wife remained adamant that she wanted him turned
 into somebody, and wanted her pick of somebodies -- somehow I didn't think
 Harry Clearwater would suit her, let alone Aro -- and the other brother
 was up to us, as he couldn't be restored in his original form.
 
\emph on
He
\emph default
 might be the new Harry.
 Addy made an appointment for the wife to come in before the last family's
 appointment to pick her somebody off the limited menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She wound up deciding, on Addy's advice, to help herself to a Sicilian vampire
 who'd been executed in 1986 as part of a newborn army (built foolishly
 close to Volterra, although there was no 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 place to hide such a project) that the Volturi had put down.
 Aro had checked everyone there for interesting witchcraft as a matter of
 routine, using his own power for the process since having been deprived
 of Eleazar but before the acquisition of Addy.
 The Sicilian in question had never been enthusiastic about being a vampire,
 never had a mate, was not a witch, and was innocuous enough of disposition
 that Addy suspected he'd suit his new vessel's wife adequately.
 He spoke Italian natively and would only be arriving twenty-five years
 out of his time, a far easier jump than John's or Didyme's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Santiago had gone into town previously to stock up on various forms of makeup,
 on the contingency that we'd need it for exactly this purpose.
 It took a lot of the stuff, caked on in thick layers, to make the woman's
 husband resemble his intended self, but eventually we managed a passable
 job (allowing for the changes that turning had wrought) and fetched a mirror.
 Addy and I blasted him with a second dose of the Sicilian fellow together,
 each at touch range in case that did anything to juice up the magic, and
 she held the reflective surface in front of his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\noun on
Aaaaaaah!
\noun default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was his first reaction.
 This was reasonable enough, since the last thing he remembered was Aro
 laying his hand across his forehead and then clucking to himself and saying
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, by which he'd meant 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kill him".
 But as we pulled our hands away from his face, he blinked, sat up dizzily,
 and looked around.
 He felt at his throat, ran his tongue over his teeth, looked at his arm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm...
 what...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He stared at Addy, then at me, then at the woman who was, legally, his
 wife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He answered to his name, took some calming down from what he recalled as
 a near-death experience, was rather thrown by but pleased with his change
 of species, and was bemusedly accepting of the fact that he was now invited
 to live the life of the human he inhabited.
 We gave the couple the necessary contact information to get in touch with
 the Golden Coven if that were necessary, summarized the relevant rules
 about discretion, and sent them home.
 As they walked out via the office building, I heard the wife chattering
 about the pros and cons of the man going by the human's original name or
 the Sicilian vampire's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last family consisted entirely of one grown son, who listened gravely
 to my explanation of what had happened to his father, and told me politely
 but firmly that he didn't think any further magical fooling around was
 likely to be helpful and he'd prefer to just take his father home and take
 care of him there.
 He seemed to be operating under the theory that the condition might lift
 on its own at least to the extent that his father would be able to walk
 around and do simple tasks, which I thought was unlikely, but couldn't
 definitively rule out.
 Addy wrote him a large check out of the Empire checkbook (connected to
 the old Volturi accounts, appropriated in the coup) as reparations and
 to help cover the cost of looking after the man, gave him our contact info
 in case he changed his mind, and sent him on his way.
 The patient could technically walk, but it wasn't wise to oblige him to
 do so for long distances, so Addy took the wheelchair that one of Heidi's
 parcels had left in her handicapped-accessible bus and donated it to the
 cause.

I took up the makeup kit, complete with bits of putty to smooth and sculpt
 over their faces, and began work on she-who-would-be-Sue first.
 I muttered in Latin, attempting to keep a chantlike rhythm, even though
 I was only talking about the process as I inexpertly added to and painted
 the face.
 I had memories from people who'd done various forms of art and makeup,
 but it didn't translate automatically to body memory or procedural expertise,
 just vague competence.
 Seth observed that I didn't sound very ominous, so I deepened my voice
 as far as it would go, which wasn't far; this caused all three of them
 to crack up, although Cody laughed distractedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I finished a passable Sue face, slowed down by the patient's insistence
 on delirious murmuring, and decided to make up Harry before resurrecting
 either so I could do the pair of them in rapid sequence.
 (I'd have tried simultaneity, but I wasn't sure if I could do even one
 resurrection completely alone.) He was faster -- there was more resemblance
 to start with -- and eventually they both looked like they might be able
 to see their intended selves in the mirror.

 flawed recall and no reason to cling tightly to the images.

Cody dipped his head in acknowledgement, his eyes fixed on the man I was
 about to turn into his father.
 There were three months and change of vampire memories and the usual fragments

 I held the mirror in place.

Oh, god.

 Cody with no recognition and he didn't acknowledge my presence, or my guards,
