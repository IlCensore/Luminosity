Timer

\begin_layout Standard
Cowed somewhat by the many ways we could still be slaughtered even with
 Pera's help, I excused myself meekly and ran back to the mountain where
 Jake was recuperating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I got close enough, my mother shielded me again, which I noticed because
 I was abruptly able to notice that Allirea was perched on the mountainside
 eating an orange.
 I wasn't sure why she'd do that in favor of hunting an animal, even if
 my mother wasn't permitting her to eat humans the way she normally would.
 It could have been sheer laziness, I supposed, since fading didn't work
 on animals and they would run from her if chased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother still had her phone out, sitting open on the rock next to her,
 so I assumed she'd heard everything, and I just waved at her in acknowledgement
 before settling beside Jake again.
 He was sleeping, albeit more fitfully than before; I touched his cheek
 and attempted to calm him with another blank sending, to decent effect.
\end_layout

Will you let me braid your hair?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked in a low voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's still braided from when I did it on the plane ride,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 Since I'd gotten it cut I'd been able to braid it myself, although it was
 threatening to get too long for that again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There are wisps coming out all over the place,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, sounding like she was fighting to keep her voice even, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and the strands are mismatched...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, shrugging, and turned away from her.
 She knelt behind me and undid and re-plaited my hair, more slowly than
 I remembered, but it was easy enough to ignore since she was pretty good
 at not pulling it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She twisted the elastic around the end of the braid when she'd finished.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't dare try to parent you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she murmured, quietly enough that I wasn't sure if she meant me to hear
 at all.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't dare claim any closeness, because of what she did to you, and because
 I don't dare do anything that might drive you away more...
 but I can't 
\emph on
forget
\emph default
 that you're my daughter, I can't pretend that you're some arbitrary girl
 who's signed onto the cause...
 and I don't know what that leaves me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, you get Dad back, if we win,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 I didn't have much of anything 
\emph on
against
\emph default
 my mother.
 I didn't want her to feel bad.
 But making her not feel bad in the way she wanted would involve some form
 of subterfuge.
 While her shield's current state meant that I might be able to pull it
 off without Magic being able to give me away, it still wasn't my strong
 suit or something I wanted very much to practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't know 
\emph on
how
\emph default
 to undo Chelsea's work the other way around.
 It didn't feel like the sort of thing that fell under my bailiwick.
 There was nothing particularly untrue about her destructive tendencies
 -- I didn't think I could make myself love my mother again just because
 I once had any more than I should expect to bring people back from the
 dead just by pointing out that they had previously lived.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She ran her palm across my hair, once, and then let her hand drop to her
 side.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's something,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she muttered ruefully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's your mate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I pointed out, unnecessarily.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't that supposed to make it more than just something?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She took a step back from me, and I turned my head to look at her; she was
 staring skyward.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe it'll be different when I see him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said finally.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
You're
\emph default
 right here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you can kill Chelsea.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Believe me, that's my intention.
 Somehow I doubt it's going to be like fairy tales in which slaying an evil
 witch causes all of her ongoing effects to evaporate, though.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said uncomfortably.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Probably not.
 Chelsea's cousin had a power sort of like hers except she dealt more with
 negative relationships, and what she'd done didn't go away that Chelsea
 could detect when she died.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still looking up at the sky, my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe we're wrong and her work does depend on her continuing to live.
 Maybe you'll learn to undo it...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said dubiously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My magic itched, but I didn't tell her anyway, that I wasn't sure if I 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 exercise that ability that way given the chance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a silence, my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Am I going to need to kill Afton too, do you think?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Probably not you personally,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's too good in a fight and you've only been a vampire for six years and
 change, I don't think you could kill him if you tried.
 But yeah, if Chelsea dies he won't exactly stand for it, and if you're
 going to kill her he'll probably need to be out of the way first.
 Actually, killing him might make her somewhat Marcus-like and make it a
 lot easier to do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The variation in how vampires cope with the loss of mates is...
 strange,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think you had it about right when you conjectured that it was connected
 to witchcraft,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Marcus is practically a zombie mostly because he can still see his half
 of the mate bond.
 It 
\emph on
looks
\emph default
 like a torn white ribbon, but he knows it means his mate is dead.
 And he has to stare at it twenty-four hours a day.
 The few times he's managed to look away from it for a second, he's been
 much more typical in his reaction -- which would be sort of like Irina.
 She was focused on revenge above everything else but she was able to be
 basically sane about it.
 I mean, up until the point where her plan backfired and the people she
 wanted dead were instead collected by the Volturi except for the ones who
 escaped altogether.
 Then she did something very stupid, running at the contingent of Volturi
 who were in La Push all by herself, but up until that point she was mostly
 functional.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And Jasper felt Alice dying, for all that this was apparently a fake by
 Addy...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah.
 Well, and part of the craziness you saw was because Alice was sharing visions
 with him and he didn't know how to handle them or what they were, but a
 good chunk of it was Addy's stunt,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And since she can only share visions while she's having them, and what she
 was primarily trying to communicate was that she was alive, this involved
 a lot of images of her lying on the floor of the dungeon under Alec's power
 staring blankly into space.
 Or in little bits.
 So there's that.
 But I'm pretty sure that what Addy did had an effect too.
 You just 
\emph on
heard
\emph default
 what you thought was Dad dying is all -- I mean, I'm sure it was horrible,
 but it wasn't like feeling it directly, or staring at evidence of it all
 the time forever.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And you think Chelsea's power will make her react with unusual intensity
 if Afton dies?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Like a combination of regular mate death, and the worst kind of drug withdrawal,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Drug withdrawal,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother mused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How does that work?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd offer to show you, but...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right.
 I am working on it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

He's almost ready.
 His heart is speeding up.
 Soon it will stop and he will look at me with new eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
He
\emph default
 must
\emph on
 love me.
 There has been no change in the twist of leathery-feeling admiration that
 I spun out of the original seed since I bit him.
 That's not enough.
 I want him to 
\emph default
adore
\emph on
 me.
 I want him to 
\emph default
need
\emph on
 me.
 This isn't enough.
 I figured out yesterday that he must be my mate or I wouldn't want him
 so much.
 That means that I'm supposed to be his mate, too, doesn't it? He's supposed
 to be mine.
 But there's no impenetrable diamond, not yet.
 There's nothing particularly durable about this string.
 I could cut it if I wanted, leave him with nothing at all -- his other
 connections have stopped trying to grow back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I
\emph default
 don't
\emph on
 want to do that.
 It's inadequate, this thin little tendril of rope, even though I've poured
 more work into it than anything else I've ever crafted and don't know how
 to pull it any tauter or force it to grow any bigger.
 It's still not enough.
 He must 
\emph default
love
\emph on
 me.
 More than 
\emph default
this
\emph on

 Where is 
\emph default
my
\emph on
 diamond link to my mate...? I can't feel the half of it extending out from
 myself.
 I can't feel any of my 
\emph default
own
\emph on
 relationships.
 It must be there, I suppose Marcus would see it if he looked, but I ought
 to be able to feel Afton's, but 
\emph default
I
\emph on
 can't tell and I don't know what to do to make sure everything is as it
 ought to be when Afton doesn't feel diamond-ly towards me -- 
\emph default
he must love me
\emph on
, why hasn't it happened yet...?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Did I -- no, it's impossible, but -- did I ruin something, interfering with
 the relationship before he turned -- 
\emph default
no,
\emph on
 that can't happen, that's not how it works, it must simply not kick in
 until his heart stops.
 That's what it must be.
 I haven't ruined everything.
 This must be normal, is all.
 Why would a vampire mate bond exist before he's completely a vampire? I
 shouldn't worry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I'm worried.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I'm

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I wish one of the others had needed to turn their own mate, so I would know
 what happens.
 Then I would

know
\emph on
 this is normal, and only to be expected, and that Afton will love me properly
 when he's through changing...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I do know that.
 He must love me, that's all.
 He must.

His heart beats faster, louder, it's humming so fast and there is still

no diamond love coiling itself around me

This morning I caught him a couple of humans to relieve the thirst that

 They're tied up nearby.
 He attacks them instinctively without even looking at me.

He didn't even look at me

Everything I created before, every thread I poured myself into bolstering,
 was a faint squeak of a prelude to this.
 He's mine.

Bella,

 My mother snatched it up and held it to her ear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she asked.

Razi dropped by for about four seconds.
 He and Pera are going to get on a plane to join us here so she can hide
 everybody and get us to Europe safely,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They should be here tomorrow afternoon, by which time it should be reasonably
 safe to move Jacob.
 Bella, Pera still doesn't like you due to the thing where she was your
 singer and you almost ate her, so don't antagonize her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Noted,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Should I apologize to her, or just avoid interacting with her as much as
 possible?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're going to have to get a bead on her preferences on the matter yourself
 when she shows up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Four seconds wasn't long enough for Razi to go into a lot of detail about
 Pera's current attitudes towards you.
 Anyway, Pera's iffy on actually participating in the fight after we finish
 traveling, but she's willing to hear us out en route to Europe, and Razi
 says he's still trying to talk her around.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure, they're 
\emph on
talking
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I heard Tanya say skeptically.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's sure what 
\emph on
I'd
\emph default
 do if I'd just found my mate and we were invisible to everyone around us
 and had more than half a day of an airplane ride ahead of us during which
 there was nothing in particular we had to do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, and I suspected she was rolling her eyes, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

so he's probably only 
\emph on
intermittently
\emph default
 trying to talk her around, but he did have verbal information to convey
 about her when he dropped in, so there is at least some conversation happening.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Speaking of mates,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there should probably be some contingency plan for if someone on our side
 winds up mated to someone on theirs.
 I assume not everybody we're calling an ally has already personally met
 every member of the Volturi guard.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You assume correctly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think we should wait to find that out until we launch an offensive.
 I think Elspeth should show everyone working with us a slideshow of the
 current guard -- since we know from our experiment with Razi and Pera that
 her method works as well as Alice's, and more comfortably -- once we're
 all massed in London.
 Then we can use those pairings, if applicable, to pry off a few more opponents
 from the guard the way we just did with Pera.
 As long as we're ready for the possibility and they aren't thinking about
 it, we 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 be able to avoid having it go the other way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Such as how?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nobody else we're working with can teleport in, and nobody else with the
 Volturi can get privacy right away so effectively.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm aware of that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The obvious thing would be to have the half of the pair we've got to stand
 in some easily recognizeable place, like under the Eiffel Tower, and get
 Alice to send their mate an image of that.
 At some time when they aren't about to touch Aro, moreover.
 We can give our half a sign to hold -- `come here alone and don't tell
 them where you're going' or something.
 Then Elspeth can be hiding nearby and deprogram the Volturi in question
 when he or she shows up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Presumably I'd have to be well away from the Eiffel Tower when Alice did
 the shared vision?

Yes,

When Alice says that everyone who should be in the compound is, me and Allirea

 Siobhan said.

Pessimistically, let's assume that deprogrammed wolves etcetera want nothing
 to do with our fight, and either evacuate entirely or hole up in the village.
 They won't be able to attack anyone in your contingent between your imprint
 status and Allirea's fading, so if they were hostile you could get a message
 to us, so we don't need to be concerned about the possibility that they'll
 turn on us anyway -- we can just steer clear if going to the village would
 be liable to provoke a fight.

If the wolves help,

they could have Rachel or Becky wait nearby -- not doing anything suspicious

 But Allirea would have to unfade briefly to let her know to do that.

Aro is wearing Marcus's eye to use it as a prosthetic vision device.
 What makes us think he doesn't have some part of -- of Edward on his person?

That's possible,

 Siobhan allowed.

Unlike the eye, which needs line of sight to be useful, it wouldn't matter
 if he were wearing such a piece of Edward under his sleeve or something,
 so Alice might not have seen...
 what's your point?

My point is that just like Demetri could notice Allirea whether she faded
 or not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Edward can probably notice me whether or not Allirea is fading me.
 If Aro is constantly reading him, that means he might be able to notice
 thoughts about me -- even if it's only Edward reading Allirea thinking
 about me, since he can't hear my thoughts directly.
 And unlike with Marcus's eye, we can't prevent that just by avoiding line
 of sight.
 If my shield slips, then no matter where we are in Edward's range, this
 is a risk.

 my mother asked.

I'm aware we can't wait for his reassembly before proceeding with the attack

 he could be taken away as a weapon from the enemy.

Alistair is a tracker, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He can tell where various people are.
 If he were the third person, he could go in with Allirea, keep his sense
 on the lookout for Aro, not be particularly inclined to think about my
 mother, and let Allirea kill a bunch of people before running into anyone
 who can notice her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I didn't remember a great deal about Alistair, in spite of him styling
 himself Carlisle's friend, but I was familiar with the basics of how his
 power (mostly deployed to let him stay far away from his fellow persons)
 worked.
 His power was a lot like Harry Clearwater's had been.

\begin_layout Standard
There was a pause while my mother and Siobhan thought that over, and then
 Siobhan said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay, that's our current default steps one and two.
 Elspeth, Alistair, and Allirea, latter two faded, break into the village,
 deprogram the wolves and imprints and pups, and then Alistair and Allirea
 go into the compound together with Alistair executing a planned pattern
 of announcing Aro's location even though he won't be able to remember that
 Allirea is there.
 However, I'm 
\emph on
somewhat

 concerned about Alistair's reliability.
 Do we have any other ideas for the case where he absconds in the night
 rather than follow through with anything so risky?

I don't get reasons.

 I know when would be best to come visit your island and when would be best

 Couple awkward limits to it, though.
 F'rinstance, doesn't help me think of especially clever things to time

Told you -- I don't get reasons, just times.
 The other limit is that I need to have roughly the right time scale in
 mind to get the most useful answer.
 If I'm thinking that I want to visit Bath sometime this week, I'll know
 the best time this week, but if I'm thinking I want to go sometime this
 decade, I'll know the best time this decade, which isn't likely to be this
 week.
 That's gotten me into trouble once or twice.
