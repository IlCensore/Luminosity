\begin_layout Chapter
Restorer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We left Marcus and Didyme alone, or relatively so -- we didn't go far, just
 went to talk about the other five blast victims in a separate room.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't turn her, at least not yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother warned Marcus before departing, and he nodded once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We should probably bring in the families one at a time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, starting to pace.
 Renata followed her around, a blank, distant look on her face.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy, there's no way to get back the people they originally were?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Since Addy was more actively involved in the conversation, I took over
 translating for John.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not really, no,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They don't contain those memories anymore, or not accessibly.
 If I'd read them ahead of time, maybe it could be done.
 As is, the best I can imagine doing would be to read their social circles
 and give them an idea of who they're 
\emph on
supposed
\emph default
 to be from outside perspectives.
 And I'm not sure if that would hold.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can we `turn them into' other dead people?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother wanted to know.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or are they stuck like this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It would be worth a try, if that were a desirable outcome,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think Didyme and John were resurrected, as it were, because they were
 very young at the time they were read.
 It's probably just a coincidence that they actually died shortly afterwards.
 Well, most very young vampires Aro read only when they were young did die
 shortly thereafter, but that's not 
\emph on
why
\emph default
 those two instead of someone older.
 There's no obvious reason that, say, this gentleman couldn't turn into
 the 400 
\noun on
bce
\noun default
 edition of Stefan...
 I just don't think we can turn him into the 500 
\noun on
ce
\noun default
 version.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She pointed at one of the mnemic overload victims who did indeed vaguely
 resemble Stefan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stefan?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not saying we need another Stefan.
 One is probably enough, and think of how confused Vladimir would be.
 I'm just pointing out that this guy looks sort of like him, only taller,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Depending on how flexible the recognizing-oneself-in-the-mirror thing is,
 there's at least a dozen vampires we've got backed up that he could be
 convinced he is, and similar options for the others.
 If Sukutai hadn't left already, maybe she or I could mess with their coloring
 and get more variety.
 I suppose that much could be accomplished with ordinary hair dye and makeup.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, scrutinizing the patients with a frown.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

We need to bring in the families.
 Everybody in the immediate family of each patient, one at a time.
 Paola's first, since I imagine Didyme and Marcus want her turned promptly
 and I think they should know what's going on first.
 Addy, will you handle that? Call them and set up appointments with one
 family per day for the next six or seven? Tell them to come in through
 the office building entrance, and we can have you meet them there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure thing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, and she slipped out into the hallway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, if you don't mind, I'll want you at those meetings to help the
 information be met with something other than inconvenient disbelief,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother went on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

And now that Jacob is no longer up at bizarre hours negotiating the long-term
 plans of the wolves,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and is heading up the pack that works for me, tell him he needs to get his
 sleep schedule under control and have at least two wolves following you
 around as bodyguards.
 He should probably take at least one of those slots himself when he's awake.
 I don't think you're 
\emph on
overwhelmingly
\emph default
 likely to be attacked or I'd want you to stick with me and your daddy and
 Renata twenty-four hours a day, but it would be good to have you visibly
 guarded anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded, waited a moment for further instructions, and ducked out when
 there were none.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake was disgruntled about being awoken after only six hours of sleep, but
 grudgingly acknowledged that if we were going to be in town for another
 week dealing with blast victims, it was probably worth his time to become
 vaguely diurnal again.
 I told him what my mother had said about keeping a guard detail on me,
 and he summoned Grace to join him in flanking me everywhere I went for
 the rest of the day, and tagged Embry and Gwyn to take the first night
 shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is it pretty definite who's in your pack to stay, now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uh, let's see if I remember everybody,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said sheepishly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Grace and Embry and Gwyn.
 Zach.
 ...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Paul? No, not Paul.
 I have it written down somewhere,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he added, fumbling around in one of the drawers in his room.
 Eventually he came up with a wad of euros and an untidily-scrawled chart
 of which wolves were going where, which I scanned and memorized.
 Jake's pack was the largest, Becky's the second even if one didn't count
 Cody, but none of the wolves under Jake were likely to bring children with
 them.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is Maggie still around or did she go home already? I owe her money.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He brandished the bills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's around,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but might not be for that much longer.
 Her witchcraft doesn't totally overlap with my dad's, but it's close enough
 that I think she's just going to head back to Wexford and live her life
 like before with Gianna and Molly.
 I'm not sure what Ilario and Cath are planning to do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't owe Ilario or Cath money.
 Do you have anything pressing going on or can we find Maggie and pay her
 back?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm free until Paola's relatives show up, I think,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and I led him and Grace into the compound and along halls until
 we found the lie-detector's temporary room -- she'd taken over Jane's,
 and I repressed a shiver as I leaned into the open doorway.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maggie?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maggie looked up from Jane's jewelry box, which she was apparently looting;
 a string of pearls dangled from her hands and she'd already sorted the
 top tray into four piles.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi, Elspeth.
 What's up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I believe I owe you a hundred euros,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jake, handing over the money he'd counted out.
 Maggie plucked it from his hand, re-counted it, and put it in her pocket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thanks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you going home soon?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, I have a flight up tonight,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Maggie said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Would've gone yesterday when the bulk of the other nonessential personnel
 cleared out, but Cath and Ilario can't make up their minds about whether
 they're going to live with me and Gianna or in Swindon yet, and I'm trying
 to balance going home to my family pronto with being able to tell Molly
 when she should expect to see her Unclario again.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you stealing Jane's jewelry?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Grace, peering at the pearls that Maggie was still holding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jane 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 dead,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Maggie pointed out innocently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I asked Alec -- you know, her only surviving relative and therefore totally
 the executor of her estate -- if he cared what happened to her stuff, and
 he said no, so I'm looking through it.
 Why, do you want some of it? She had ridiculous amounts.
 I think Aro might have given her something expensive and shiny every time
 she had a birthday.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That was actually true, although she'd worn out or lost or sold a fair
 fraction of the pieces over the years to avoid being buried under them.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is box two of six.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grace blinked, then glanced at Jake for permission, got a shrug, and started
 rummaging through what Maggie hadn't already claimed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't looting fun?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Maggie asked, humming to herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess my dad probably knows what's going on and would tell my mom,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said dubiously, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and my mom would have said something if she objected, but...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pfft,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Maggie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She rules the world now.
 Why bother with how a dead evil girl's stuff is disposed of? I guess some
 of the stuff in the treasury would be worth her hanging onto -- the historicall
y significant antiques and whatnot -- but she's not going to stop me from
 taking this bee-yoo-tee-ful hair clip, I think.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Maggie tucked an enameled pin into her curls.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or giving my mate a pretty bracelet.
 Other people are going through the other rooms.
 You could take some stuff, Elspeth, I bet you know where everything you'd
 like is.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grace retreated from the heap of jewelry to stand at my shoulder again,
 newly ornamented, but I didn't want anything of Jane's.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll think about it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, idly contemplating the other deceased owners of nice things and
 what they'd have left behind.
 I didn't think I'd wind up taking any of it.
 I wasn't much for jewelry anyway, and somehow didn't think it was going
 to be a limited resource in my future if I changed my mind.
 My mom was having enough fun with being the Empress of the Golden Empire
 that I wouldn't be astounded if she had a crown made for me and insisted
 that I wear it to official functions, with such functions to be concocted
 out of thin air later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grace wanted to alert everyone else in the village to the looting opportunity,
 and I didn't have any reason to direct her elsewhere, so back we went.

\begin_layout Standard
Paola's relatives arrived that afternoon -- just her parents and both of
 her brothers.
 Her sisters-in-law and her nieces and nephews were home; I suspected that
 it would be up to her more immediate family what, if anything, to tell
 them.
 Jake and Grace and I waited with Addy for them to arrive at their appointment.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This doesn't look like a hospital,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Giotto, the elder of the brothers, as they walked into the office
 building that contained one of several entrances to the Volterra compound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was in fact not even slightly a mental hospital -- the offices in the
 building were mostly financial and legal -- but we didn't stay in the building
 long.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This way, please,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I addressed the Grecos, catching their eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Who are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Rino, the middle Greco child.
\end_layout

My name is Elspeth Cullen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said, glancing at Addy.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dr.
 Cullen and I -- I'm Dr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Addy inserted smoothly.
 Until we were in the compound itself, we weren't going to start telling
 the truth.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The facility where Miss Greco is staying is not here; this is just the most
 convenient entrance.
 Please, follow us.

\begin_layout Standard
Using the key that allowed the building's elevator to drop as far as the
 basement level, we accessed the tunnel that led to the compound.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What kind of hospital has a tunnel entrance?

 Giotto wanted to know.

No,

 I said.
 Addy was borrowing Aro's power so she could read the Grecos when it was

 I sighed, turned back to the unsettled family, and created the most minimal,
 unintrusive summary I could compose to send to all of them.

And Giotto stood stock-still, processing the information, and then lurched
 angrily at Addy, who ducked his attempt at an attack neatly and then seized
 his wrists so he wouldn't fall over.

The four Grecos all went rather quiet at that, and Addy said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and began marching Rino and Giotto down the hall briskly.
 I made an expansive gesture, inviting Mr.

 Greco to go under their own power ahead of me and the two wolves instead
 of needing to be hauled as their sons were.
 Mr.
 Greco's mouth worked soundlessly for a moment, but finally he put his hand
 on his wife's shoulder and they turned and continued towards the compound.

 asked Giotto, sounding queasy about applying digital terminology to his

Something like that.
 Paola was overwritten with the memories of a woman who

 I said.

And even if Paola had records kept, she was a human, and our theorizing

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, keeping it simple.
 I didn't think it would make them feel any better to describe how happy
 Marcus was to have her.
 In fact, it seemed likely to be a bad idea to require the Grecos to interact
 with Marcus...
 possibly ever.
 Anyone that happy about what was, to them, a tragedy would probably be
 painful to be around.

For her part, Didyme was very gracious to the Grecos.
 She clasped their hands warmly and greeted her brothers by name -- having
 been coached ahead of time on what they were called -- and her parents
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Mamma
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

PapÃ 
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, which words she'd learned for the occasion in spite of knowing no other
 Italian.
 She endured their mistrustful, uncomfortable stares with an apologetic
 smile, and assured them through my translation that she was very sorry
 to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

arrived
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the expense of their Paola, but eager to be a part of their family anyway
 on the grounds of blood relation if they'd have her.
 Or willing to bow out quietly if they didn't want to deal with the stranger
 who had taken over their daughter's body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rino did most of the talking once the family was actually in the room with
 Didyme.
 He wanted to know about her, in her original incarnation -- where she'd
 come from, what her life had been like, how she'd died -- and she obliged
 them with enough details that one would think she was speaking to intimates
 and not approximate strangers.
 She even described how Aro had killed her -- which she still didn't remember,
 and had only been told about -- and this seemed to rouse some fraternal
 protectiveness in Rino.

 Mrs.
 Greco interrupted abruptly when Rino was halfway through asking Didyme
 about the fragments of her childhood she recalled.
 (I was actually better able to answer such questions than she was, since
 Aro had read his sister before he turned her and the new Didyme held almost
 exclusively vampire memories, but I knew Rino didn't want to talk to

It is true that Aro turned me, the first time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 acknowledged Didyme,

 But there are advantages to being a vampire.

Didyme didn't take the bait.
 She said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am sorry if you do not approve.
 This matter is between me and my husband, with the kind permission of Her
 Imperial Majesty.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Didyme seemed to be adjusting very well to my mom being the ruler of the
 vampires; it might have been helpful that she'd lived during the Romanians'
 reign and they'd never impinged on her life while she fell under their
 technical jurisdiction.)

Didyme nodded and her smile got a bit wider at the thought of Marcus.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He is not here because it was thought that he would be intruding on our

 I suppose we have been married for more than two thousand years, now.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said after a pause.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

In a way.
 Legally I suppose I am Paola Greco, and Paola Greco is not legally married.

\begin_layout Standard

Are you sure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, but take me to him anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Rino with a resigned sigh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marcus was standing in the next room over, unwilling to get too far from
 Didyme and having compromised only that far because of the delicacy of
 the situation with her family.
 Since Rino seemed to be the only one interested in being introduced, I
 got up and led him next door, leaving Addy in the room with Didyme and
 the other three Grecos as backup translator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rino visibly recoiled when he first got a look at Marcus and his shattered
 face, but controlled himself; Marcus gazed back impassively with a slightly
 unfocused look in his eyes, and I suspected he was examining the relationships
 emanating from Rino more than Rino's person.

Fluently,

 Marcus replied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rino chewed on the inside of his cheek a bit, and then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're a vampire, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Marcus didn't even distinguish this question with a nod, let alone a verbal
 reply, and Rino moved on after an awkward lull.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How many people have you killed?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked boldly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't count them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Marcus, a low edge of menace in the sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I laughed nervously and added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rino, um, killing people is illegal now, so however many it was, the number's
 not going to go up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I just want to know if...

 said Rino.
 He paused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Marcus, meanwhile, did not exactly draw himself up to his full height, because
 he hadn't been slouching, but he did adjust his shoulders and peer down
 at Rino in a way that Rino obviously found intimidating.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 shrieked Rino, shuffling backwards almost into the hall.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Calm down! Last month my sister's name was Paola, and the most challenge

Marcus stared Rino down, in stony silence, and I piped up,

She's the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Rino backed up a few more steps, looking warily at Marcus from narrowed
 eyes, and went back to the room with his parents and brother and sister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of the visit passed stiffly, although Didyme's sweetness was unfailing
 and her brothers, at least, were doing their best to adjust to the situation.
 Her parents were huffy and indignant by turns, casting about for someone
 more breakable than (unflappable) Addy or more detestable than (kind) Didyme
 to blame for the situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After having agreed to my parents' satisfaction and with various levels
 of irkedness that it would be a poor choice to go to the newspapers with
 the secrets they had learned, the Grecos finally took their leave.
 It was late evening, and they trooped out muttering awkwardly about keeping
 in touch via various media that Didyme did not know how to use.
 Me and Jake and Grace escorted them out to the office building exit --
 it wasn't well-lit, and while there weren't branching corridors to get
 lost via and going 
\emph on
up
\emph default
 from the basement didn't require a key, it seemed prudent to have them
 accompanied.
 When the Grecos were safely out the door, my wolf guards and I all headed
 back to the village, because I, at least, needed to get to bed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After I was tucked in with my hand in Jake's, but before I nodded off, I
 heard from next door Albert and his imprint Amanda having some sort of
 dispute.
 It sounded more like Amanda was shouting and Albert was panicking about
 the fact that she was shouting, actually.
 Their baby Eve was fussing loudly, unaccustomed to disagreements in her
 vicinity.
