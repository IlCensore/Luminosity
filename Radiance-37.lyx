\begin_layout Standard
I woke up in our hotel room again, tucked into bed and in the company of
 the same four vampires.

\end_inset

Oh, you're up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Rosalie when I opened my eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good morning.
 Siobhan talked Alice and Jasper into letting you try to de-Chelsea them
 like you did with your wolf.
 He's okay, by the way.
 Choked down some more food late last night, otherwise mostly sleeping.
 He woke up and was lucid enough to talk for a bit a few hours ago, so Bella
 told him where you were and that you were safe and so on and he seemed
 to take it all right.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's good,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are we going to go back to Denali soon?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Siobhan didn't say,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Emmett.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're supposed to call back after you try fixing Alice and Jasper.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and I climbed out of bed and walked over to Alice, holding out
 my hand.
 She took it, and I tried, just as I had with Jake before.
 
\emph on
I'm so sorry I seeded you.
 I was wrong, please don't think what I let her make you think...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice didn't visibly react, but Emmett prodded, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, pseudo-sis, what's your up-to-date opinion on...
 say...
 the Volturi's in-house brain-scrambler?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chelsea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Alice, sounding vague, and scrunching up her nose as she placed the
 description.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's...
 well, if she didn't exist I'd probably still be gravel, but I think that's
 the nicest thing I can think of to say about her unless I went into her
 value as a go opponent, in which capacity she'd be pretty easy to replace.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you were a chess girl,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remarked Rosalie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Only when I have Edward around to play.
 Anyone else, I have an unfair advantage, playing a game I'm that familiar
 with.
 Give me long enough and I wouldn't want to play go with anyone besides
 Edward, either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She tilted her head.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are we going to get him out?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do we want Bella to let us live?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Rosalie, raising an eyebrow.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe Elspeth could give you a run for your money at chess.
 You can't see her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyway, that seems to have...
 partially...
 worked.
 Jasper?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dropped Alice's hand and took Jasper's, repeating the procedure.
 He was similarly noncommital about the Volturi when Emmett asked.
 It wasn't clear to me that this was an actual improvement -- they hadn't
 gone back to Volterra when called, after all, so Chelsea had clearly been
 wearing off some anyway -- but Rosalie dialed Siobhan's number and reported
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

success, not a resounding success, but a success".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I took out my own phone to join in the call without having to piggyback
 on Rosalie's.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's next?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did I miss anything while I was asleep?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just generic catchup and speculation.
 You're the only one with all of the memories besides me; you're useful
 to bounce things off of, and I wanted to know how much effect we can expect
 from you deprogramming people besides Jacob before committing to a next
 action.
 Everything has been fairly quiet, and with Demetri dead and the Volturi
 not knowing it, we can afford to bide a little time.
 As to what's next: next, I try adding various subtitles to the piece of
 paper Alice may show Marcus, to narrow down his possible reactions so we
 can make a more precise

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 demanded Siobhan.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Marcus is in the dungeon in bits, next to my father and David,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 snapped Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see the future, not the past!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Everyone else began to mutter in low voices, some over the phone, some
 in the hotel room, but I focused on Alice and Siobhan's voices.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And in the future as far as I can see, he's a pile of rocks like the other
 two!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wait...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Like my father.
 Like my father, whose uncontrollability hadn't made keeping Addy around
 a priority because simply by touching him Aro could -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Alice, look at 
\emph on
Aro

 -- show me

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aro was standing in his throne room, sighing sadly, patting Chelsea's hand
 -- he's speaking to Caius -- sideways he confers with Renata, gravely,
 he will thank Santiago for something -- sideways he collects the entire
 guard, delivers a speech -- he's dictating an explanation for Corin to
 deliver to the wolves -- he's placing an apologetic kiss on Chelsea's forehead,
 looking fatherly -- sideways, he shifts to stand, and his hood falls away
 from his head, and
\begin_inset space ~

And he is wearing, around his neck, a choker made of wire which presses

Oh my word,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 whispered Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As long as they leave his eye intact, can it -?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It must,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Normal vision no -- normal vision the eye needs to be physically connected
 to the brain -- but Marcus can see relationships with his eyes closed,
 why not with his eyes detached...? And if that hadn't worked they could accomplish
 the same thing by just taking his head off entire, he wouldn't be much
 danger that way either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Ew
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Rosalie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Also, that is bad, bad news.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If that works and Aro was willing to try it, why didn't he do it a week
 ago, after the compound was first blasted?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan demanded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why wait?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He was away at the time, or Caius wouldn't have ordered Addy executed.
 He wouldn't have come back until the day after or the day after that...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's still about a week ago,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is a 
\emph on
weighty
\emph default
 decision, but it's a straightforward one.
 Marcus had a certain risk of learning about Didyme's death on any given
 day and a certainty of learning it eventually; and there was a relatively
 fixed risk of any cover story associated with neutralizing Marcus getting
 that information out early.
 Chelsea in particular is the one he needs to be concerned with.
 Alice said her visions indicated a tendency for Chelsea to panic and try
 to run away if she learned of it.
 Now, Chelsea wasn't in the compound at the time.
 She was in Nicaragua with Aro.
 But 
\emph on
Afton
\emph default
 was in the blast and she'll believe anything he tells her, so she could
 still find out in a way that she'd have to take seriously if he stumbles
 across the memory or if she has him confirm someone else's statement.
 Or a shared vision.
 And then she could panic and try to run away.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chelsea is...
 I guess you could call it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

addicted"...
 to being loved...
 and without her mate she would basically be unable to function.
 She might get hit even worse than Marcus did, I'm not sure.
 To the point where I don't think Aro would dare hurt Afton, actually, since
 Chelsea 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 essential to the operation, but that wouldn't stop her from freaking out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think we may have to revise our opinions of what Aro would and would not
 dare,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 growled Jasper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He can't use 
\emph on
Chelsea's
\emph default
 power by proxy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 Jasper shot Alice a nervous look.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or Alice's, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I added reassuringly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Her power would be so much less useful with the steering under her own control
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd buy that it took Aro twelve hours to come to a decision and act.
 Not a week,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And last night, Alice saw Marcus standing in his room, reacting to the shared
 vision she'd planned to give him like it was 
\emph on
news
\emph default
.
 She never actually sent it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe Aro didn't exactly come to a decision.
 Marcus -- or someone else who would have told Marcus -- could have just
 come across the information overnight by chance,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and then Marcus could have gone nuts and gotten himself dismantled for his
 trouble, and now he's an eye in a necklace and scree in a dungeon.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 muttered Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but then whoever told him would certainly have been found out by now, and
 I have some doubt that Marcus could have been incapacitated before managing
 to shout something suggestive.
 Alice, check the others in the guard...?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice closed her eyes, and after a minute, she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All present and accounted for and physically contiguous except me and Jazz,
 Marcus, and Demetri.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And Addy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And Addy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan muttered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy sent Jasper and Alice away...
 Alice? Can you see her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and I couldn't see her when she called me, either.
 She's probably with a half-vampire or a wolf.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does it have to be a 
\emph on
half-
\emph default
vampire?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked suddenly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Noemi has a quarter-human son, can you see him?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice shook her head, slowly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan muttered something unimportant, then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice, you and Jasper checked the wolf village -- did you take attendance,
 or ask if everyone was there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jasper shook his head, muttering a negative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Even if they had,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that wouldn't necessarily have done the trick; people are often away from
 the village on errands for more than just a day or two and that's nothing
 unusual, I wouldn't expect anybody to mention it as a worrisome thing.
 The day the blast hit, Shawn was in Venice, just him and Lise and Sarah
 while Camellia stayed home with her toddlers...
 And Nina and Olivia would have made their grocery run later that day.
 And Addy would know all that as well as I would.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So there was an opportunity for Addy to kidnap or entice away a wolf,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 summarized Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

which Alice can't check up on directly, or Addy could have the company of
 Noemi, Iseul, Noemi's son, or...
 some other hybrid.
 But still...
 why would Addy have notified Marcus? Or, for that matter, arranged for
 Alice and Jasper to desert?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jasper didn't seem to like the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

desert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, probably an artifact of his military background (I wondered if he was
 technically an 
\emph on
actual
\emph default
 deserter, not having returned to duty after being turned into a vampire...)
 but he didn't protest out loud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is she trying to be helpful?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Rosalie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's certainly a 
\emph on
strange
\emph default
 way to demonstrate it, but the effects...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The effects include the fact that any chance we had of 
\emph on
directing
\emph default
 Marcus's reaction to finding out about Didyme are gone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan pointed out.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 be accidental, since however it happened it didn't involve Alice, but I'm
 not going to count Addy as an ally just yet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fair enough,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Rosalie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 she trying to do? If she's got your power, shouldn't we assume that she's
 
\emph on
succeeding at it
\emph default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or at least making progress,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 acknowledged Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 be trying to render herself necessary to the Volturi again, and it's only
 a matter of her bad luck that Marcus turns out to be...
 usable...
 without his acquiescence 
\emph on
or
\emph default
 hers.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're relying on someone with Siobhan's power having bad luck?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Jasper dryly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My power is not 
\emph on
good luck
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 snapped Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's good 
\emph on
planning
\emph default
 if it's anything.
 If Addy did communicate with Marcus somehow, then we shouldn't assume on
 that basis that everything turned out exactly the way she wanted it by
 chance -- we should assume that she has adequate 
\emph on
contingency
\emph default
 plans to recover from any misfortune this result represents.
 
\emph on
If she was involved at all
\emph default
, which we do 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 know, since nearly forty people were blasted with those memories 
\emph on
including Marcus himself
\emph default
.
 Marcus could have found the information without help, reacted in one of
 several ways that caused him to be disassembled without leaving anyone
 else knowing too much for their own good, and become a prisoner that way.
 He could have been informed by one of the guard, who Aro forgave for some
 reason.
 Or Aro could have preemptively attacked on the understanding that Marcus
 would 
\emph on
eventually
\emph default
 find out, although that leaves us with the puzzle of why Aro would have
 waited for a week.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy might have gotten rid of your power by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I pointed out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I doubt it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's possible, but seems unlikely to me.
 I tend not to stick with single plans start to finish -- I revise on the
 fly to react to new information.
 If she could 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

taste
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that, then she'd hang onto the power until she was done accomplishing whatever
 it is she wants to accomplish.
 She's fairly good at not changing powers by accident.

That would be a very drastic thing to try,

 Siobhan said,

since she doesn't have any good way of getting at me to replace the planning
 power if she needs it again.
 She might do it anyway, but it'd probably be when she was confident in
 being near the end of her plan or after putting in motion some series of
 events that would let her have access to me again.
 I don't know what she's aiming at, but I doubt the current state of the
 world is it, so my guess is that she's still holding onto my power.

Plausible.
 Without knowing the official story, it's hard to guess how hard it would

 Marcus

Alice,

 I added, even though I was growing to hate the experience of watching a

 Alice closed her eyes again...

\begin_layout Standard
There was a silence, and Alice said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and then the conversation turned to trivialities such as how Alice and
 Jasper would get on the plane (they had ID forged on their behalf in Italy,
 but the Volturi were aware of it and would be able to notice where they
 were going) and where we were going (Denali, but only because Jake couldn't
 be moved; as soon as he was well enough to travel, and, ideally, the local
 purveyors of forged documents had filled rush orders for all the undocumented
 vampires, we would fly out to Heathrow and join the British contingent).

Wait,

 said Alice, while we were halfway out the door of the hotel room.
 Siobhan was still on the phone.

The Volturi can track our ID, like you said.
 They might wait until they're sure Demetri isn't coming back, but even
 if they do, this whole mess might take longer than that.

we

And?

They could turn her into a hostage.

Siobhan sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go ahead and extract her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and bring her with you, but I don't think you had better bring her to Denali
 proper, not if you're going to leave her human.
 Put her up in a hotel in Fairbanks.
 I should probably tell Bella to bring in her parents and stepfather and
 any extended family she has alive, too...

I think she'll say no,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I predicted, as I and the four vampires arranged ourselves snugly in Rosalie's
 new car.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Volturi can't contact her -- as far as they know, she's alone with no
 phone and an e-mail she's not going to check, and it'd be reasonable to
 bet she's immune to Dwi, so they can't contact her that way.
 There's no way for a hostage notification to reach her, so there's no reason
 to take her parents or stepfather or any other humans she cares about.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll tell her regardless,

 Alice, give me your niece's full name and we can go ahead and add her to
 your flight.
 You have enough leeway that as long as you get her to go with you in under

It took a lot more repetition and pleading, an impromptu demonstration of
 Emmett's superhuman abilities in the form of plate-juggling, and an exacting
 comparison of Alice's face with the one surviving photograph of human Alice

 (Alice sat on Jasper's lap to make room.) Genevieve called her cousin Hattie
 about Snowflake the dog and then packed a bag with our help.
 I spent the rest of the car trip to Nashville gently explaining to her
 the same basic concepts over and over.
 It was surprisingly difficult to make it sink in -- she didn't think I
 was lying, but once advanced the opinion that I was

 there was no longer a reason to keep the Denali houses visibly innocent
