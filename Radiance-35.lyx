\begin_layout Standard
When I woke up, my mother promptly released my hand, not making eye contact.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Couldn't make it work,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she murmured.
 I felt sorry for her, a little -- I didn't care if she wanted to watch
 my dreams, but it obviously mattered to her that she no longer could.
 Sometime overnight she'd taken back the jewelry she'd tossed me during
 the previous day's fight; she was wearing her rings, her bracelet, and
 her locket with my father's wedding ring strung onto the chain.
 Rosalie and Emmett were nearby, with three packed bags, waiting for me.
\end_layout

Morning, early-bird,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Emmett.

We have enough time before the flight for you to hunt, if you like,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Rosalie said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

or we can stop and get you something on the way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't feel like trying to kill anything while I had an injury, and I'd
 gotten more used to human food over the past month and a half.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's just get something at the airport,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, sitting up and gently prodding my shoulder.
 It was tender, but as long as I didn't crazily windmill my arms I thought
 it would be all better by the evening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked at Jake.
 He was still fast asleep.
 I smoothed his hair again, and sent him a summary of where I was going
 and why so he wouldn't be confused when he woke up with no one but my mother
 nearby.
 He didn't stir, but I assumed it would be there for him to remember when
 he woke up and wondered where I was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I followed Rosalie and Emmett out of the mountain range to where they'd
 parked a car -- I didn't know if it was hers or one of the Denalis', but
 I hadn't seen it before.
 She drove, and the pair of them engaged me in gentle conversation about
 how each of us had spent the five years following my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disappearance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (as Rosalie kept calling it -- I had a hard time thinking of myself as
 having disappeared).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had Rosalie's memories up until the day she'd been to Volterra to retrieve
 Ilario from his sickbed.
 Demetri had noticed her, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invited
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 her to the compound for a brief visit, and conducted her to Aro, who read
 her, all in the time it took the hospital to deem Ilario ready to travel.
 The Volturi had let her go without incident or subtext-laden conversation,
 although Aro had pressed a jeweled hairclip on her.
 It was a fairly routine check -- which left me with recollections of most
 of my aunt's life, and through her eyes, a majority of Emmett's too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emmett found this fascinating.
 He kept asking me for numbers of various memory types -- how many times
 did I remember getting married, how many firsthand perspectives did I have
 on the fall of Rome, how many authentic Sanskrit accents could I do, how
 many books I now had memorized, how many instruments could I now play if
 I got my hands on them.
 I couldn't answer most questions like that without at least a few hours
 to look for the answers.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lots,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I tended to answer each such question, or sometimes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

several
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, followed by a few examples, which he seemed to find just as satisfactory
 as a numerical answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rosalie wanted me to settle a long-running argument between her and her
 husband about whether or not she had in fact seen Elvis in a department
 store in 1960; she'd told Emmett she had, but he was skeptical, and on
 inspection I was pretty sure he was right.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 look like him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said when Rosalie pouted at this pronouncement, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but I think Elvis was across the country at the time, so it was probably
 just someone else.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Rosalie did not ask me to arbitrate any other disagreements, and subsequently
 only wanted to hear things I knew from the memories of an ill-fated race
 car factory employee Aro had once eaten.
 By the time we arrived at the airport, Rosalie had a lot of outdated corporate
 espionage on Lamborghini.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We got onto our airplane with little fuss, after stopping to buy me several
 sandwiches and bags of snackfood.
 I nibbled through these absentmindedly between my turns in our ongoing
 conversation, which had begun to revolve around art history and how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unbelievably cute
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it was that I remembered a lot of it.
 Rosalie teased tangles out of my hair.
 Emmett informed me that I'd been loaned some of Kate's clothes, again,
 which were in the suitcase they'd packed for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do either of you actually know how to go about looking up Alice?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked during a lull in the conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Don't you have lots of memories of how to find stuff like this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 teased Emmett.

 I could probably pick out the ones that will most likely be applicable
 to 2011 Biloxi if I thought about it all day, but it would be easier if
 one of you had an idea of what to do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, first, I think we should see if the hospital is still there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Rosalie briskly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can find the building,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or if it's gone, the place where it was.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then, if it's still a hospital,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Emmett, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we talk or intimidate or sneak or trick our way into their records...
 but they probably don't have ninety-year-old patient lists with convenient
 next of kin listings.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then why go there at all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If they probably don't have records, I mean.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If it 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 have records, that's the obvious place to find what we're looking for.
 If it doesn't, then we need to find a genealogical library, or church records,
 or talk to people in a nursing home who might have known the family, or
 something like that -- how well do you know your way around Biloxi, Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Rosalie asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Modern Biloxi? Not at all.
 And even in 1920 James didn't explore much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So we'll need to consult someone for directions to places like that anyway,
 and may as well try asking at the hospital, if it's a hospital,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Rosalie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The nursing homes in particular they could probably tell us how to find.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That makes sense,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can do your honesty voice claiming Alice is your aunt, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Emmett.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's not too alienated or too non-biological or anything?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Honesty voice, is that what you call it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, I can, but I think I look too young to have an aunt who was born a
 hundred and eleven years ago.
 And we also don't know for sure if she had any siblings or was ever married
 before, and if she didn't and wasn't she couldn't have a niece of 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 age.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Genealogy is a fuzzy business,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Rosalie said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can say that you're 
\emph on
pretty sure
\emph default
 she's your aunt, and let people assume you 
\emph on
mean
\emph default
 great-aunt or great-great-aunt.
 It's possible she was an only child, but not very likely, and given the
 time scale we're looking at here, no one is likely to call you on it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emmett looked between me and Rosalie speculatively, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think we'll say you're our niece, Elspeth, on Rose's side, and that Alice
 is Rose's great-aunt and your great-great-aunt.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Me, why not you?

 Rosalie asked.

 hammering out the details of how we'd present ourselves in trying to justify
 our interest in Alice's background.

The plane landed.
 Rosalie bought a car (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I've had my eye on this model for a while...
 there's no place to put it after we're done with it, but I know a charity
 with an arm in Nashville that'll take it and then I can get another one
 later,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, sounding vaguely disdainful of rented cars in general), and I
 slept through the drive.
 By the time I woke up we were in a hotel.
 Or rather, Rosalie and I were in a hotel, and Emmett was already out and
 about learning his way around town.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Couldn't you have been nocturnal?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 sighed Rosalie, looking out at the brief remaining darkness that was letting
 her mate go out and about sans elaborate disguise.

Our sleep schedules are pretty random, I think,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Noemi is outright nocturnal.
 Cody gets up and goes to sleep a couple hours before me.
 Iseul can stay up later than I can.
 And Nahuel gets up at noon every day.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How do you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Rosalie asked, tilting her head and looking amused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I met Cody in person.
 And my parents kept Nahuel talking about how the species works for a while,
 while they were trying to figure out whether they could have me or not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied, unsure why this would be amusing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, hmph,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Rosalie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I thought you would make a confused face and not know how you knew that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why would I do that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.

\begin_layout Standard
Rosalie pursed her lips in thought, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Four, unless Nahuel...

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I scrunched my eyebrows together, wondering where the extra three came
 from, and Rosalie laughed, giving me a careful hug that avoided my shoulder
 even though it had no remaining signs of injury.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Huh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said uncertainly.
 She ruffled my hair, smiling, and then ushered me down to the hotel's cafeteria
 for breakfast.
 Emmett joined us soon enough, and the vampires sipped water while I ate
 off three plates for the sake of appearances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rosalie's comment about my schedule aside, the fact that most places we
 could go for information were not open in the middle of the night meant
 that they'd come equipped for daywalking and expected to do some of it.
 By the time I finished eating, there were enough clouds that they didn't
 need coverage even outside the car, but they did stash their sweaters and
 gloves and hats in the trunk while I directed us to the lot that had held
 Alice's sanitarium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was not a sanitarium anymore, and the building hadn't even been converted
 -- it had been knocked down entirely, and the area now appeared to be part
 of a trailer park.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, that's disappointing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remarked Emmett.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I participated very little in the rest of the hunt -- I recited facts and
 shared memories when my aunt and uncle asked me, and I followed them around
 when they left the car to cast my precognition shadow over our activities,
 but mostly I fretted about Jake and tried to distract myself from unproductive
 worry by processing recollections of interesting events.
 Rosalie and Emmett didn't seem to mind my disengagement.
 Emmett remarked, in a voice he might have thought too low for me to hear,
 that while the research project wasn't as good as getting to pulverize
 some Volturi, it was better than milling around Denali waiting for someone
 to have an idea or for the guard to get around to wiping them out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rosalie flipped through stacks of compiled genealogical data at the library
 with a sourly envious expression on her face, doubtless looking at all
 the arrows pointing from parents to their broods of children and wishing
 for the millionth time to trade what Carlisle had given her for never having
 needed it in the first place.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This lady seems to have been so popular that all three of her sons, and
 two of her daughters, named one of their girls Mary Alice after her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she muttered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That must have been a confusing family to belong to.
 I bet it was a family joke or something after the first couple...
 No wonder some of them would have gone by middle name and our Alice would
 have woken up forgetting her first name.
 Only that means we have three Mary Alice Brandons to sort through...
 ah, no, it's four, this one married a fellow adopted by another branch
 of the Brandon family and got the surname that way...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remembered that I was -- sort of -- named after my mother and my (biological)
 paternal grandmother.
 Bored anyway, I looked through what I'd been blasted with about the latter.
 I had a handful of memories about her: moth-eaten, paper-thin impressions
 that had survived her son's turning, and a few vivid hours from Carlisle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My father remembered his mother as a pleasant background fact about the
 world he'd lived in until age seventeen.
 She cooked, she scolded him when he misbehaved, she dispensed suitably
 embarrassing hugs in front of even-more-vaguely-remembered friends, she
 fretted about his intention to join the army as soon as he was able and
 fight in World War I.
 Then they both came down with the Spanish flu and rendered that plan moot.
 That was how Carlisle had encountered my father in the first place...

Mrs.
 Masen is hurting her chances, trying to nurse her son.
 I thought he would go quickly, like his father -- Edward Masen, Sr., who
 I never saw wake -- but no, she's up and at the boy's side, looking after
 him through her own illness, whenever I happen by that part of the vast
 grid of beds makeshift and otherwise.
 I start spending more time in that corner, trying to attend to her son
 so she won't feel she needs to.
 I become a little less careful about hiding my speed, a little more willing
 to stay through the times I should pretend to be sleeping when I think
 it will pass without notice.
 There are many other things for my colleagues to pay attention to than
 my late hours and rapid work, and the patients are generally too delirious
 to notice, or be believed if they do.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I come in after sunset, after a day of pretending to sleep and having nothing
 to do but dream, insofar as I can dream, of Esme.
 I can only hope the plague has spared her part of Ohio, or wherever she's
 living now, if she's moved.
 (Let her have moved.
 One of these years I won't be able to go on alone anymore, and I 
\emph default
will
\emph on
 look for her, but let her have moved, let her be impossible to find, let
 her escape this fate...) If I left Esme behind to lead a normal, happy, human
 life, only for her to fall victim to this devastation exclusive to humans
 (she would be only twenty-two, now! so young!), then no protestation of
 having left for her own good will measure up to the loss...
 I must not dwell on Esme.
 It will do her no good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
When I can emerge, I check on Elizabeth Masen and her son first.
 I'm attached to them, with their matching green eyes and bronze hair, her
 obvious self-sacrificing care for her child, his tenacious grip on life
 through a severe case of the illness.
 There have been so many patients, an endless march of them, all worth attachmen
t, but I avoid it when I can, or the job would be too heartbreaking.
 I've failed in that, here.
 Perhaps the loneliness is catching up with me in more ways than the obvious.
 Elizabeth does vaguely, distantly resemble Esme, I suppose, though I'd
 never mistake one for the other.
 I think Esme would be a devoted mother like her.
 I hope she gets that chance.
 (Another thing I would be tempted to take from her.)
\end_layout

Elizabeth's not at her son's side, but in her own bed -- I've been telling
 her over and over to stay there, but read it as a bad sign anyway.
 And I'm not wrong.

 she's too weak to fight it off anymore.

I've considered making a companion for myself.
 Considered it for decades, actually, although most sorely tempted seven
 years ago...
 just one person in the world who I would have no need to hide from, who
 I could in good conscience keep as a companion instead of an occasionally-visit
ed, ineffectually-entreated friend at a distance.
 But I have never been able to justify making anyone like myself.

There's something about his face, even in fitful, fevered sleep.
 Some goodness shining out of it.
 His mother had every right to be proud, to be protective, to -- perhaps

 If I had ever had a son, I would have wanted him to look something like
 that...

I think we have a good idea where to go next.

 had a little sister, born in 1909 when our Alice was eight, died in '86,

There are enough Mary Alices in the family that at worst she'll think you
 mixed our Alice up with one of her cousins.
 You're a cute, harmless, trustworthy little girl who's related to her and
 she's a childless spinster -- I doubt you'll have trouble getting her to
 meet us.
 Then we spring the exciting `surprise! vampires!' bombshell as gently as
 possible and hope it doesn't give her a stroke.

Genevieve lived in a small white house and kept a small white dog out in
 her yard, which stayed as far away from Rosalie and Emmett as it could
 when we walked up to the front door.
 (We had killed the afternoon reporting on our progress and making general
 chit-chat with our Denali contingent.
 Siobhan was delighted that we'd located a niece, but didn't stay on the
 phone long, only saying that she wanted another call as soon as Genevieve
 was caught up on what was going on.)

I rang the doorbell, and Genevieve answered the door.
 She was the most little-old-lady-like little old lady I had ever seen in
 my life: five feet tall, wispy snow-white hair, a face covered in smile-wrinkle

 She seemed able enough, though, ushering us in with enthusiastic gestures
 and shutting the door behind us.
 Her eyes lingered a bit on Rosalie.

 The Bible has Mary Alice in there, and if they left

She was released from the hospital by someone who worked there, but didn't
