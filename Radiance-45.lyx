Executioner
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before Addy got me all the way to the throne room, we were met in the hallway
 by my parents -- my mother still half-supporting my father, who was covered
 in shallow fissures along his skin that hadn't healed yet and leaning his
 head on her shoulder.
 The piece of his thumb that Aro had taken was back where it belonged.
 Behind them, fanned out in a nicely intimidating V, were Siobhan and Liam,
 Jasper, Tanya and Kate and Garrett and Eleazar, Nathan, and Maggie.
 I heard the voices of the others who'd made it through the battle intact,
 back in the throne room.

Unhand my daughter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy let me go without further ado, and I stumbled a step and then crossed
 the distance; my mother put her free arm around my shoulders.
 And then Addy gave me -- and to judge by the slight shifts in posture from
 everyone else except my mother, all of us -- a summary of the answers to
 her remaining mysteries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy, my mother's immune to my power now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said helpfully, before even unpacking the sending, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

she didn't get that...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy blinked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, well then, I suppose I'll have to resort to the use of language.
 How inelegant.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She coughed, for effect, then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bella, you're welcome.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And what,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said my mother, quietly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

am I welcome to?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice and Jasper,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, ticking off fingers.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stefan and Vladimir.
 Nathan.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She ticked off the entire hand, then pointed at Nathan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph on
She
\emph default
 sent you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked, turning incredulously to him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why didn't you mention that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Time wasn't proper,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said easily, smiling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you knew Nathan, why wasn't he in the dungeon with all the other useful
 witches you'd met?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother wanted to know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We hadn't met,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy corrected.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I 
\emph on
suspected
\emph default
 him when I thought about it, via very indirect mentions in Carlisle's memories
 and Edward's regarding Siobhan's coven's long-term suspicions that someone
 from thereabouts been poaching in her territory.
 The Isle of Man was on my way out, so I stopped in,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It seemed like a good time to go for a walk along that road,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reminisced Nathan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And wouldn't you know it, I was right again.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd assumed you'd heard about the meeting from the fellow in Newcastle,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Maggie indignantly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I knew Cath didn't invite you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You assumed, but you didn't ask,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Nathan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But come on.
 Would you have trusted me if you'd known Addy sent me? But I'm trustworthy.
 I was helpful, wasn't I? I did half the work!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You were,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, still fixing her gaze on Addy and holding me and my father
 close on either side of her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And Stefan and Vladimir?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Them I didn't contact directly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

An old friend -- she's got a minor tracking power, nothing compared to Demetri,
 the Volturi didn't want to bother with her -- lives near their area.
 I told her, she told them, I take it they showed up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They did,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Siobhan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And I assume you know about how I got Alice and Jasper peeled off, although
 I wasn't sure how to get them to rendezvous with you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy went on, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

so good job finding them anyway!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a silence, during which Addy smiled brightly at the dumbfounded
 collection of vampires facing her, and finally, my mother very carefully
 said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're welcome, as I said,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I imagine your next question is why, if I'm so helpful, I didn't just stick
 with Siobhan and company.
 Is that right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd think you read my mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said dryly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

except that even with my husband's toe in your pocket, you can't do that.
 Give that over, by the way, it's not yours.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll swap powers if I touch it, and I'm still using this one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said in a very reasonable tone, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

for everyone else's benefit, if not yours.
 Maggie's not comprehensive enough to notice all the little deceptions I
 could conceivably throw in.
 If I toss it over can I borrow Elspeth again for a moment?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother examined that request for barbs, then finally said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eleazar, would you go take it out of her pocket and bring it here, please?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I supposed she picked him because Addy wouldn't want to touch him; his
 power would displace mine without giving her any notable advantage.
 Eleazar broke formation and moved carefully forward, and reached into the
 front pouch on Addy's sweatshirt while she stood there innocuously with
 her hands up and a cocky smile on her face.
 He retrieved my father's toe and handed it over to its owner, who leaned
 down carefully to hold it in place for longer than it should have taken
 to reattach.
 My father straightened up and Eleazar went back into his place in the V.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy once the transfer of the toe was complete, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was hedging my bets.
 Not gonna lie.
 There's three reasons why I can't do that...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She pointed at me, at my father, and at Maggie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I'd worked overtly for your side, and you'd then lost, I'd be a fugitive
 at best and ashes at worst.
 I left Volterra on bad terms in the first place, had my leverage rendered
 pretty much moot, and was generally wanted dead -- that being why I ran
 off to begin with.
 Rescuing your daughter in the process, incidentally, Bella.
 In fact, the only way I could expect to live through a Volturi victory
 would be if they were weakened enough in the witchcraft department that
 they needed me to cover their gaps.
 So I had a double motive for taking Alice away from them, although I did
 
\emph on
hope
\emph default
 they'd find you.
 I would have convinced more of their witches to leave but didn't have an
 angle.

\begin_layout Standard

...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said my mother again, not blinking.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And now you're here because?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here to welcome our new golden-eyed overlords,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy promptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother blinked, and said flatly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're looking for a job.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've always been very clear about my motives,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy earnestly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I want witches to taste -- new, interesting, varied powers to train up and
 play with.
 I can understand how my past behavior would be...
 unsettling...
 to the point where you wouldn't like me to be running around where you
 can't keep an eye on me.
 I managed to hide from Alice for a while, but I didn't have a good way
 to predict whether you'd have Demetri after the dust settled, and even
 if you didn't I couldn't hide from Alice 
\emph on
forever
\emph default
.
 But I can potentially get what I want, or most of it, 
\emph on
while
\emph default
 you keep an eye on me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unsettling?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said my mother.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You sent my daughter to 
\emph on
Jane
\emph default
.
 You were complicit in Elspeth's imprisonment and Edward's -- in fact, you
 were essential to Edward being worth imprisoning 
\emph on
and torturing
\emph default
 in the first place.
 When you left the Volturi's sphere of influence you abandoned the rebellion
 against them as soon as you had something useful to take with you.
 You have killed...
 oh...
 how many people now? with no 
\emph on
hint
\emph default
 of being even 
\emph on
vaguely
\emph default
 open to the possibility of stopping.
 And now you want me to 
\emph on
hire
\emph default
 you while you have that 
\emph on
smug look on your face
\emph default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you going to kill me because I have a smug look on my face?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Addy lightly.
 My mother didn't answer, and Addy said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I taught your daughter to expand her power in ways that have helped her
 immensely.
 I carried her out of Volterra when I didn't have to bother.
 I sent you five allies, two of which at least you found valuable and the
 other three of which you could have found so if you'd gone with a different
 plan.
 I showed up here today instead of making you hunt me down.
 And, yes, I have a smug look on my face, because I 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 how smart you are, and I 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 how smart it would be for you to keep me in your back pocket and 
\emph on
use
\emph default
 me.
 You've got a mindreader.
 You've got a lie detector.
 You can turn 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 into someone who cannot effectively tell a lie by asking your daughter
 to poke me.
 It wouldn't be difficult to keep tabs on me, and it wouldn't be too much
 trouble to keep me happy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother stared at her, ground her teeth a little, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You want to do something useful?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mm-
\emph on
hm
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Find a piece of Vasanti, take her power, and go out and bring in some live
 nonsapient food for Edward and David and everyone on our side who was broken.
 If you set foot out of Edward's range -- I trust you're aware of how far
 it extends -- then I will have you killed, no further negotiating,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes ma'am,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, winking.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or, do you have a title picked out yet?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't.
 Shoo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, one more thing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You didn't burn Chelsea's hands with the rest of her.
 For the next two weeks or so I'll still be able to take her power by touching
 them; after that, parts that size will be starved to death.
 If there's anything you're regretting not having the chance to fix that
 requires her, I mean.
 Anyway.
 Vasaaaaanti...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She turned around and picked her way through the debris, looking for a
 piece of the animal-charmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother watched, a stricken look on her face, as Addy rounded the corner
 in her search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A chilly feeling crept up my spine and tingled at the back of my neck.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We repaired our broken comrades, mostly victims of Heidi's lure who'd been
 drawn into close range before my mother had been able to shield them for
 the moment it took to lurch away.
 Alice had sorted everyone in the throne room, friend and foe, into heaps
 during the conversation in the hall.
 I didn't directly piece anyone together, because I wasn't as fast or precise
 as a vampire, but I broadcasted blankness to everyone in pain while they
 were reassembled.
 Alice moved on into the hall to consolidate all of the other Volturi parts
 from where they were scattered throughout the compound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother put together Esme, no less rapidly than the people she worked
 next to, but there was a distant, distracted look on her face.
 My father, still covered in little cracks and trying not to move much,
 sat next to her with one hand on her knee.
 He was murmuring something to her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I took a step closer, to hear what he was saying.

I think I do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 my mother murmured back.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I know I do, really, but I feel like I shouldn't.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he told her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What Chelsea left behind isn't natural either way...
 but it could be 
\emph on
better
\emph default
, even so...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You didn't handle Elspeth very well, you know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she muttered back to him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Even with what Chelsea did to you...
 you could have done better.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm sorry, Bella.
 If you want me to let Addy undo it I will.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But it's not really 
\emph on
undoing
\emph default
 it, that's the problem,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whispered my mother.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not like Elspeth's deprogramming that really does 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 undo what was done.
 It's building something new where something old was permanently destroyed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't want it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said softly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother glanced up for a moment to look at my face, then turned back to
 Esme, half-finished, and continued putting her together.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then you don't have to take it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said quaveringly, almost under her breath.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

...

It might not stick, with you, anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It might,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I still care about Jake and the villagers, which Chelsea did, but...
 I just don't want 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 of that in my head than I already have.
 Like you said -- building something new where something was permanently
 destroyed, not undoing it for real -- and if I'm going to have that again
 I want it to be natural.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother pursed her lips tightly and nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Think about it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said tentatively, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

because you can't change your mind after Chelsea's hands die and Addy gets
 rid of the power...
 but if you don't want it you don't have to take it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll take it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Jasper gravely from where he was working on Randall.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I think Alice will too...
 we're...
 very alone, at the moment.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyone who wants it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

can have it when Addy gets back.
 She's behaving?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked, looking into my father's eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She has a herd of deer and a couple of boars following her now -- and some
 pigeons she couldn't shake off -- and she's on her way back.
 I haven't heard anything untoward.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother nodded.
 She completed enough of her work that Esme was able to sit up and finish
 the rest of it herself, and shifted a foot to the right to start work on
 Carlisle.
 Her face was solemn, and preoccupied, but calm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Alistair left after all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, not noticing him coming together under anyone's hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Offered to stay behind with Jacob and Pera and Razi,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and we decided it would be safest to take him up on that, rather than bring
 another body into the fight when he didn't want to be there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I should call Jake and tell him he can come in...

 Jacob answered and, after a brief exchange during which I repeatedly confirmed
 that I was uninjured, he said he was on his way and Alistair would follow.

Elspeth,

 said my father after I'd hung up the phone, and when everyone on our side
 who'd been damaged was reconstructed and no longer needed the blank sending,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

would you go show Marcus what's happened? He may have a reaction worth noting,
 but at the moment he doesn't know anything except that Aro was looking
 at a lot of people who have no obvious reason to be here.

Should I bring his eye back to the rest of him?

 I asked.

It rolled under that throne,

 my mother said, pointing.

\begin_layout Standard
I picked up the eye gingerly -- it was smooth and dry and cold, not very
 eyeball-like, but it was still an 
\emph on
eye
\emph default
 -- and carried it to the dungeon, which was now empty of anyone but parts
 of Marcus.
 I put the eye with the rest of him, composed a summary, and sent it over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy passed me in the hall, leading deer and wild boars behind her single
 file to their doom, and waved.
 Her eyes were a brilliant gold.
 Show of good faith, I supposed.
 I waved back, and waited.
 A minute later, my father, looking much improved, and my mother, no longer
 propping him up, entered the room.

He wants to kill Aro himself,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my father murmured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm tempted to keep Aro disassembled for use -- via Addy and Elspeth, he's
 a very good way of getting large volumes of complex information from one
 person to another -- but I think recent events have demonstrated the long-term
 non-viability of that imprisonment strategy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If we decide to kill him, and I think we have to -- even with Pera's help
 on our side, which we still can't count on, he's too much of a threat...
 The only issue I can think of with letting Marcus light the match is whether
 Marcus will make a nuisance of himself should he be permitted to heal.

He'll work for us, he'll do whatever you tell him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my father reported slowly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if you let him kill Aro for what he did.
 He worked for his mate's murderer for millennia...
 he'll promise a lot for revenge.
 But as far as I can hear, he's sincere.

He wouldn't be unusually difficult to subdue if it came to that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He has almost no practice fighting -- he's basically done 
\emph on
nothing
\emph default
 since Didyme died but help Chelsea work, and she died relatively early
 in his life.
 And his power doesn't help in combat.
 Plus he has the dead skin -- he's going to be absolutely covered in scars
 when he's put back together.
 It won't heal on the surface.
 Those will be points of weakness.

It'll probably disappoint Stefan and Vladimir,

 she said.

I suppose they should be able to content themselves with Caius, Athenodora,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Probably,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 agreed my father.

My mother frowned, but nodded slowly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll consider that...
 it's better than killing him, if only marginally...
 well, let's put Marcus together, shall we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We got him in one piece, although he still looked like a wreck.
 Unhealed lines along his skin radiated from every point of impact that
 had taken him apart in the first place, leaving him looking like a jigsaw
 puzzle even when he was complete.
 But he sat up, and climbed with difficulty to his feet, and bowed to my
 mother and then to my father and then to me with no trace of irony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This way,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said, and we showed him into the throne room.

All too well.
 I know which pile is his.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Should we keep a piece?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Addy asked, from the portion of the throne room where she was keeping the
 remaining couple of deer calm in spite of the other vampires.

It won't be able to read anyone itself with his brain gone, I think, but
 I'd have a couple weeks able to read non-witches.

Do you care either way?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked Marcus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he murmured, eyes fixed on the pile, and Cath, who was nearest -- and had
 newly gold eyes, I noted, probably having deigned to feed on one of the
 animals after being reconstructed -- picked up what looked like Aro's knee
 and stepped away from the pile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother gingerly handed Marcus her lighter, and he did the deed swiftly
 and without discernable enjoyment of any kind.
 I thought there might have been a grim satisfaction around the corners
 of his eyes, but it was hard to read 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 expression on the scar-webbed face.
 Aro burned, and Marcus turned back to my mother, returned the lighter,
 and bowed again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Someone -- Cath -- find clothes for everyone, but not those awful black
 cloaks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother instructed, noting that a great many of the vampires in the room
 were naked.
 Cath zipped out of the room to obey.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Marcus, help yourself to one of the deer Addy brought us.
 Don't touch her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He drifted towards the animals and fed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, deprogram him in case there's anything left after what they did
 to him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did, but Marcus looked up after finishing his deer.
 He looked strange -- subdued glitter under the evening sunlight falling
 on him through the narrow window, craquelure complexion, gold bleeding
 into his dark eyes as I watched.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At first, the only thing that told me that Aro did not mean to do me a favor,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said quietly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

was the fact that he left one of my eyes in the dungeon, where it could
 see the ribbon.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I blinked, then understood.
 If Aro had worn both eyes, or put the second one somewhere else entirely,
 Marcus wouldn't have had to look at the evidence of Didyme's loss.
 Marcus might have done that to 
\emph on
himself
\emph default
 -- torn out his own eyes, let them die, permanently severed himself from
 his agonizing power -- if his ability to see relationships hadn't been
 the entire reason he was obliged to stick around.
 But once it occurred to Aro to just wear one of the eyes, there would be
 no reason for that.
 The rest of the disassembly could have been some kind of subterfuge to
 explain the sudden change of Marcus's status to the rest of the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Aro hadn't left the second eye there, Marcus might have considered it
 a relief, on the whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Peeking at Marcus's memories, I saw that he'd asked for permission to take
 out his eyes once Addy had joined the guard, and been refused on the grounds
 that Addy was still new, was too busy copying anyone and everyone, might
 find a mate and leave at the drop of a hat, needed her own relationships
 manipulated and couldn't very well help Chelsea there, and was less experienced
 in assisting Chelsea anyway.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's how I found the...
 relevant memory,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Marcus added quietly, and he gritted his teeth.
 The corpse of the deer he'd eaten slumped to the floor as he stood.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't know why else he would do that, if not to help...
 and so I sought, and found, the memory of my wife's murder, but could do
 nothing about it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 My mother nodded.
 Marcus spread his hands.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What would you have of me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sit tight for now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you really want to take your eyes out and put them somewhere else, go
 ahead, just don't lose them or let them die.
 When Cath gives you clothes, put them on.
 There has been too much incidental nudity in my life recently.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She ran a hand over her scalp, like she wanted to adjust her hair, but
 there was barely any new growth since the last time she'd been set on fire.
 (My father twitched when I thought that.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother pointed at several of our comrades.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Find boxes or bags or something and move all the Volturi from where they
 are in the compound and collect them here.
 And someone eat that last deer so Addy can ditch Vasanti's power and take
 Alec's.
 I don't care to 
\emph on

\emph default
 anyone when it's not necessary.

\begin_layout Standard
The people she'd pointed at left to bring back scattered guard.
 Cath returned with enough clothes for everyone naked, the outfits pilfered
 from assorted closets.
 Marcus put his designated outfit on and then departed silently, presumably
 to tuck his eyes away in a safe nook.
 My mother looked on as Volturi accumulated in the throne room.
 Garrett ate the deer and Addy switched powers, waiting at the ready to
 anesthetize the assembled when they were all in one place.
 At last Mary and Randall carried in the last two -- who it was they brought,
 I couldn't tell -- and stood back to let Addy do her work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deprogram all of them, and we'll go case-by-case on the potentially salvageable.
 With Aro gone, we can summarily write off Sulpicia.
 Is there any reason to keep Caius and Athenodora?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I deprogrammed all of the Volturi as she asked, and was about to weigh
 in on the subject of Caius and his mate, but Siobhan spoke first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're not witches, Caius is loyal to Aro dating back to before Chelsea,
 and they're symbols of the old guard,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That last means that if you 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 turn Caius it would make it easier to get some of the other guard, but
 not significantly more than it will be with Marcus...
 and he'd be hard to turn.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother nodded once.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That last also means I wouldn't trust them imprisoned in the hiding place...
 even if Pera would make up her mind in a positive direction about whether
 she'll serve as warden for the new order.
 They'd have too much potential to rally support for a resurgence of the
 Volturi.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She sighed and passed a hand across her eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stefan, Vladimir, would you like to do the honors? And Jane, too.
 Jane...
 needs to go.
 Leave Alec.

\begin_layout Standard
The short, ancient vampires nodded eagerly, undisguised glee in their eyes,
 and produced matches from their pockets, obtained before the assault had
 begun.
 They threw them from a safe distance into the relevant piles, directed
 by Alice, who knew which person was which.
 Four more fires were soon crackling away busily.

 my mother called after me as I leaned into my wolf's open arms, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

why don't you go to the village, show-and-tell the other wolves and the
