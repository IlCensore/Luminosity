I hear the guard now except for Addy,

 Edward signed to me.
 We were just barely more than one mile from the field.
 Only the fact that nobody was raising their voice kept us from being able
 to listen directly to their conversation.
 Only thick tree cover kept us from being able to see them, up to and including
 the whites of their eyes.
 And vice versa.
 I held very still, moving only my hands to reply.

And?

Aro's still hoping to recruit me.
 They haven't gotten to the subject of you yet.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, if they're hoping to recruit you, then that does limit what they can
 do to me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I answered.
 A hot flare of hope lit somewhere in my chest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward nodded, a guarded grin spreading across his face.
 Then it disappeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I signed, alarmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Run,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he whispered, his hands unavailable to communicate silently because he
 was grabbing my hand and pulling me away.
 I couldn't keep up with his top speed, but he wasn't about to leave me
 behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm slowing you down, we should split up, he can't track me and can't catch
 you
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I started to say.
 I didn't know why we were running, what he'd heard, but before I'd had
 a chance to try to convince Edward to let go of my hand and take off in
 another direction, we were tackled from behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I snapped my head around enough to recognize Leah's wolf form.
 She was the fastest wolf, faster than me, maybe not faster than Edward
 but he'd been trying to keep pace with me, and we could have fought off
 one wolf together but the others caught up almost at once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leah and at least one other wolf snapped their heads towards me and I flung
 out my one free hand to try to defend myself.
 I couldn't tell if I'd done any damage because I was in pieces an instant
 later.
 My ears stopped working.
 My eyes were unresponsive.
 I couldn't inhale to see if my nose was working.
 That was just as well because I couldn't have processed any sensory input
 through the shattering pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pain, all by itself, wasn't as bad as turning, although it was in the
 same class.
 But it wasn't only pain: my proprioception was desperately confused.
 It was insisting that every direction was down.
 I sort of thought that I might be able to move some of my muscles, but
 the input from them was unclear, fuzzed out in comparison to the sharp
 awareness of the damage -- I could try to twitch a finger but I didn't
 know whether I'd managed it or what the finger might be touching.
 I couldn't do anything, couldn't help

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sensations apart from the pain were impossible to interpret, and my
 sense of time was shot to hell.
 I could have been in a heap moments later or scattered across a football
 field the following week, still in the mouths of several wolves or

There was a sensation I recognized: I was on fire.

That
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't scream.
 Couldn't flail around.
 There was only pain and dizziness and terror and 
\emph on
I was going to die
\emph default
 and what kind of shield could represent itself as protection for my mind
 if it was going to let my mind cease to

exist

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt something -- something that wasn't pain.
 I couldn't be 
\emph on
healing
\emph default
, not shattered into a hundred fragments and burning, but I 
\emph on
felt something
\emph default
, like I was under a blanket that hugged my surface -- my shield? Manifesting
 in some form I could detect only 
\emph on
now
\emph default
, when it would die with me?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tried to pull it in, willed it to put out the fire, 
\emph on
come on, shield, if you want my mind safe you have to let it have someplace
 to live -- the mind is not safe without the body
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shield sucked in closer to me and the fire was out and I was violently
 rearranged into my normal shape.
 The pain didn't fade at once.
 I was still broken along all the original fracture points, though the shards
 of my body had been forced flush with their neighbors.
 My eyes and ears didn't return to me immediately.
 But those wounds knitted, though they went sluggishly.
 A lot of the venom had burned out of me.
 There was enough left that I 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 heal, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't try to move.
 I didn't want to dislodge the rearrangement my shield had provided.
 But I could look around when my vision came back.
 I was in a deep pit, on top of a heap of ashes.
 Harry and Sue, I guessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe Edward.
 Maybe he'd been killed first and I was lying on top of his ashes.
 I recoiled from the thought.
 They hadn't planned to kill him; perhaps they truly hadn't, perhaps he'd
 only pulled us away from the field because they were going to kill 
\emph on
me
\emph default
, he might be alive
\begin_inset space ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of my ears started working.
 Sounds echoed crazily between the walls of the pit, reaching my ear in
 a distorted timbre.

my matches,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 grumbled a man's voice I hadn't heard before.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Damn wet climate.
 Go ask Jane if she has a lighter, will you?
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Didn't think we were going to kill this one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said an unfamiliar woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Doesn't surprise me.
 You'd get it if you had a mate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the man.
 There were footsteps, receding and then approaching again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward thought I was dead -- they all thought I was dead -- reasonable enough
 given that I'd been broken into a hundred pieces and set on fire -- they'd
 wanted to control him but that plan had been shot to hell when they'd killed
 me
\begin_inset space ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tried to move, I had to do something, I had to save him, 
\emph on
he
\emph default
 had no shield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dragged my left arm close to me, and felt the snug blanket of my shield
 shift with it, but I was fragile.
 Deep fissures ran along my skin; if I applied any pressure to the limb
 it would break again.
 I was dangerously low on venom; it might not be able to get me whole even
 if I didn't worsen the injuries.
 I couldn't even get out of the ash pit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here's your lighter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the woman.

Thanks, Addy, you're a peach,

There was a crackling noise.
 My Edward, on fire, I couldn't

In the pit?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Addy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pit was to keep the smoke away from the wolves, they're gone now, no point,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 I didn't know whether to be glad of that or not; I couldn't bear to watch
 him die but I couldn't bear that he was alone, that he thought 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 was dead.
 I might as well be.

Dunno how well the wolf thing'll work,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said skeptically.
 I wanted them to shut up.
 I didn't want to listen to this, I wanted the silence back, I wanted to
 have no idea what was going on around me when what was going on was that

Don't think you and Chelsea did a good job of it?
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We did a fine job.
 She's fun to work with,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And the wolves are interesting material -- so interwoven; tweak one thing
 and they all change.
 But I mean things like the way that black one passed out when it smelled
 the smoke from those newborns.
 Biological stuff.
 Are they worth the complications?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 My lungs regained their integrity; I was sure I could have taken a breath.
 I didn't.
 They'd hear me.
 They'd probably only ignored the sound of my arm moving because it could
 have been part of the fire that was supposed to be consuming me.
 I willed it back.
 Willed the flames to spring into existence again, trade this pain for that
 one.
 But I wasn't a pyrokineticist, I was a shield.
 That was the only reason I was alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward would have wanted me to live.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cracks in the arm I could see were getting shallower.
 The physical pain, at least, was at a manageable level.
 The hollow, dead feeling in my chest wasn't the sort of thing the venom
 would ever heal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Edward would have wanted me to live.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I lay there, inert, listening to the crackling and popping of the fire as
 it widowed me.
 Listening to Addy and whoever the man was make small talk over his smoldering
 remains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aro thinks so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the man said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course.
 And he knows more about the matter than I do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Still, it seems to present a logistical challenge.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted her to die.
 I wanted whoever she was talking to, to die.
 I wanted Aro dead and his 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

brothers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dead and their wives dead and every person who had ever peaceably wandered
 the halls of their compound 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
 including me because Edward was gone and I couldn't stand it and if I were
 dead I wouldn't have to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would have wanted me to live.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you think the coven will be a problem?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the man asked.

No, I doubt it

 Addy began.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Coming, boss!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Some gesture of Aro's I hadn't been able to hear, maybe, calling them away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Footsteps receded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward would have wanted me to live.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remained still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visible damage, at least, healed.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My thirst did not care that I was alone.
 It came anyway, the insistent burn in my throat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I watched the sun rise, and watched little diamonds dance across my smoothed-ove
r skin.
 All that, and the only scar on me was the bite mark on my wrist.
 But the trauma and recovery, if it could be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recovery
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, had taken a lot out of me.
 If I didn't get blood soon I wasn't sure exactly what would happen, but
 it wouldn't be conducive to my health.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hadn't heard anything, all night.
 The Volturi had been and gone, the wolves with them.
 No one had even looked into the ash pit.
 I could safely climb out and hunt, now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward would have wanted it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I pulled myself into a sitting position.
 I felt brittle, but not achy or tired.
 I could move around.
 I was in adequate shape to kill an animal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I climbed out of the hole, slower than I needed to go.
 I looked around at the dewy field, down into the pit where Harry and Sue
 had been carelessly dumped.
 Any humans who wandered through this place and found the greasy ashes would
 think it was from a barbecue or something.
 No one would mistake it for a grave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I kicked a little dirt over the ash, but couldn't muster any enthusaism
 for a serious burial.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Harry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sue.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Just their names.
 Acknowledging that I knew they were there, or that the transformed matter
 that they'd once inhabited was there, anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I dared to turn around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a heap of ashes in the middle of the field, indistinguishable
 from the ones I'd been lying on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't say his name.
 It wouldn't come to my lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I approached the pile, silently, and touched the ash.
 It wasn't even warm anymore; I'd been waiting for nothing in the hole in
 the ground long enough that they'd cooled.
 I picked up one sliver of charcoal gently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to put it in my locket.
 I didn't have my locket anymore -- or my rings, or my bracelet, or my clothes,
 or my wallet, or my hair.
 My shield had saved me from the fire, but not my possessions, and hair
 didn't heal as flesh did.
 The jewelry at least might have fallen off when I was originally tackled.
 I wandered in that direction, cradling the piece of ash in my palm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I actually did find the necklace.
 The clasp was broken, but the chain was mostly intact and the charm was
 fine.
 I tied the chain around my neck, and opened the locket to put the ash between
 the pictures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Elspeth...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to look for the rest of my jewelry.
 The rings, at 
\emph on
least
\emph default
, the physical evidence that Edward had existed, that he'd loved me, that
 he'd been mine.
 But finding the locket had taken long enough and I was unbearably thirsty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I listened.
 The forest was relatively clear of wildlife -- sensible, given how many
 vampires had been swarming around the place over the last who-knew-how-long.
 I didn't know what day it was.
 I'd lost all the cues of time when I'd been in fragments.
 It was still autumn, at least.
 But I heard some elk, at the borders of my hearing, and I chased them down
 and killed three and drank them dry.
 The taste of herbivores was rancid but I was past caring.
 I needed the burn soothed.
 Strength flowed back into my limbs as I absorbed the blood.
 Too little, too late, but I was physically back to normal apart from being
 bald.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I noticed, when I'd filled up, that I could still feel my shield.
 It hadn't ranked as a significant sensation when I'd been thirsty, but
 now that I thought of it there was a definite layer of 
\emph on
something
\emph default
 wrapped around me.
 I touched my arm, but my fingers didn't detect anything -- it was some
 second layer of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feeling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then, like the second channel of hearing Edward had...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My train of thought derailed at once.
 I made an involuntary choking noise and coughed up a droplet of sour blood.
 Would it be like that forever? Every thought leading to Edward, every thought
 of Edward throwing me into fresh grief? I couldn't function that way.
 That wouldn't have mattered -- but Edward would have wanted me to 
\emph on
live
\emph default
, to be 
\emph on
alive
\emph default
, not just to fail to be a heap of ashes.
 I knew he would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
I won't 
\emph default
let
\emph on
 you die...
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I could remember his voice so clearly.
 So honeyed and certain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wished with all my heart that he'd loved me less, enough that he could
 have run without me.
 He could have gotten away.
 They hadn't 
\emph on
planned
\emph default
 to kill him, he'd said.
 They wouldn't have needed to if he hadn't been too distraught over 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 to ever be recruited.
 The fact that I had been able to survive the attack only made it more appalling
 that he'd lost his life that way.
 But even if I'd been completely burnt, he could have been fine.
 If he'd loved me less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went back and looked for my rings.
 I found the bracelet first; one of its diamonds poked out from under a
 leaf.
 Some of the silver pieces were slightly munched.
 It was less flexible than it had been.
 But I put it on anyway, and kept looking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I found my engagement ring first.
 The ring part had been bent out of shape but the lattice of gems was all
 right.
 The wedding band was nearby and looked fine; I put that on, but didn't
 dare try to tap the other ring into shape.
 I'd find a way to get it repaired professionally.
 For the time being I threaded it onto the locket's chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't find Edward's ring anywhere.
 I searched every inch of the forest in a plausible radius of where we'd
 been caught, I followed the path from there to the field, I shut my eyes
 and forced myself to feel through the pile of ashes.
 It wasn't there, even in the form of a melted lump of gold.
 I didn't know what could have happened to it.
 Had one of the Volturi bothered to steal it while leaving mine untouched?
 Why? What would they want with it? I retraced all my steps, looking for
 disturbed soil where it could have been stomped into the ground, going
 through heaps of discarded foliage one needle at a time.
 Nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I probably 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 have paced back and forth stark naked in the woods looking for the ring
 for the rest of my life, it didn't seem like the kind of 
\emph on
living
\emph default
 Edward would have wanted me to do.
 I was beginning to think that I was forever going to have to motivate myself
 to do anything that way.
 That I would never be able to accomplish tasks that I couldn't somehow
 make 
\emph on
about Edward
\emph default
, about what 
\emph on
Edward
\emph default
 would have wanted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about Elspeth?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Everyone
\emph default
 thought I was dead -- or if they didn't now, they would soon enough, when
 the news got out.
 That gave me a measure of safety.
 And her as well.
 No one would be looking for me, and she would not be sought as bait for
 a trap intended for a dead woman.
 She was safe in Denali.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I went to get her, then my in-laws would know I wasn't dead.
 That would eventually get back to the Volturi.
 Then, I wouldn't just need to lie low, I'd need to run, and Elspeth could
 be in danger.
 I had ample evidence that my protections weren't worth a damn for anyone
 else.
 It hadn't done anything for Edward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted her, I wanted to try to fill the hole Edward's death had left in
 me with our daughter, I wanted to cradle her close and let her warm me
 up, I wanted to stroke the hair that was so much like his, I wanted to
 see her father's face in her dreams again.
 I wanted her to know that she was only half-orphaned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I 
\emph on
needed
\emph default
 her to be safe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had lost more than I could stand to lose.
 If Elspeth died, I didn't know if I would be capable of going on, even
 given what I knew Edward would have wanted.
 She was the last living part of him, and she had to go on breathing.

I wandered towards the village, where supposedly everyone was dead or kidnapped
 and everything burned.
 Everything was.
 Charred husks of homes crumbled around me as I walked through the deserted
 reservation.
 I went farther, towards Harry's shack.
 It was intact, or at least as intact as it had ever gotten to be from its
 original tumbledown state.
 There were some clothes inside.
 I took an outfit of Sue's.
 She wouldn't need it and no one would miss it.
 She had a small collection of scarves.
 I wrapped one around my hairless scalp.
 Between the baldness and the now-constant feel of my shield clinging to
 my skin, I felt terribly strange.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wondered why the village wasn't crawling with cops, suspecting arson.
 Charlie should have been there, prowling the area, trying to figure out
 what had happened.
 Maybe the Volturi had intervened with some police connection and the destructio
n was officially a natural disaster.
 Maybe I'd been in bite-sized chunks for a few weeks and all of the detective
 work had been and gone.
 Maybe Charlie was dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Charlie didn't approach the importance of Edward or Elspeth, but I could
 check on

 He wouldn't notice me if I hid well enough.
 I could stake out his house for a while and see if he was going about his
 life normally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wondered if Carlisle and the others would bother to tell my father I was
 dead.
 Would it make him safer or less safe to believe that? I couldn't keep in
 touch with him; if there were actual

evidence

 in his inbox or phone call history that I was alive then that could be
 found one day.
 But if he simply

thought

 I was alive, on the grounds that no one had told him otherwise, that might
 be fine.
 Unless he started digging around to find out why I wasn't answering my
 phone or my e-mail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RenÃ©e was probably in less danger than Charlie either way.
 She wasn't a cop and couldn't get the same kind of attention if she became
 inquisitive.
 I supposed I could go to Florida and skulk around her house, to see if
 she went on crying jags or otherwise indicated that she believed me dead.

Such a trip turned out to be unnecessary.
 At nightfall, I went into Forks and climbed Charlie's next-door neighbor's
 chimney.
 I hid behind it, pressed between the bricks and the shingles and leaning
 just enough to see Charlie's house.
 His cruiser wasn't there.
 I didn't see my old truck, either.
 I didn't particularly care.
 It'd be noticed if it went missing, so I couldn't exactly take it.
 I'd travel faster on foot anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I waited several hours, half an eye on Charlie's empty house.
 The rest of my mind was on Edward.
 On my memories of him.
 It was like chewing on broken glass to think of them, but I couldn't stop
 myself.
 I needed Edward, and if all I could have were memories, then that was what
 I'd take.

I bit my lip, almost hard enough to pierce the skin.
 I considered doing that on purpose -- it would be distracting, at least,
 and my

 He was driving it, so he was alive, at least for the time being.
 He did look bereaved...

 They'd been his best friends.
 Their deaths alone could do that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He parked in the driveway and went inside.
 I heard him put something in the microwave.
 Then he picked up the phone and dialed it.
 I could faintly hear the beeps; by their pitch, I knew it was RenÃ©e's number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't close enough to make out RenÃ©e's half of the conversation; I jumped
 lightly from the neighbor's roof onto the ground and darted immediately
 into a shrub with a good angle to his window, so I could see what Charlie
 was doing as well as hear.
 I was wearing long sleeves and dark colors, but that didn't mean nobody
 could see me if they were looking the wrong way while I wasn't behind cover.

 He was trying to convince RenÃ©e that I was dead without going into the
 evidence.
 He'd evidently not looked at the field with the vampire ashes, because
 he could have seen me in the pit, but even I hadn't known what vampire
 ashes looked like until I saw them.
 So the absence of the correct kind of ash in La Push proper wouldn't necessaril

 But the sheer destruction, my lack of contact, and the fact that he knew
 I was up to my neck in the mess with the wolves would have.

One second,

 said Charlie in an unstable voice, and he put my mother on hold and turned
 away from the phone and brought both fists down on his kitchen table, a
 scream of rage boiling up from somewhere deep in his chest.
 He lifted his hands and curled them into fists in his hair, then struck
 the table again, making noises of frustration and grief.
 He knew Elspeth had been born already.
 He'd seen her baby pictures.
 He knew he was a grandfather.
 He'd never be able to tell RenÃ©e that she was a grandmother already, that
 she hadn't lost that chance when I'd

 He had no way to get in touch with his granddaughter.
 He didn't know if she was alive.

\begin_layout Standard
I was a little tempted to show myself.
 But oddly, Charlie's pain didn't strike me as deeply as it would have a
 month ago.
 I didn't like it, but it was safer this way.
 The impulse to comfort him was shallow.
 The need to prevent more of my family from dying was deep.
 My parents had to think I was dead.
 Everyone did.

Charlie exhausted his need to yell and hit things.

 He hung up without waiting for her to answer, and stood as still as a human

I had nowhere in particular to be.
 Nothing in particular to do.
 I could go anywhere except a few hazardous locations.
 It was a pity that those were the only places I wanted to be -- Denali,
 where my daughter was.
 Volterra, where a lot of people I wanted to kill were.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I walked toward Chicago.
 Edward's birthplace.
 I didn't bother running -- there was no hurry.
 On sunny days I stayed put in uninhabited areas, to reduce the odds of
 being noticed as too glittery by some human.
 I took in a lot of scenery.
 I ate animals unfortunate enough to cross my path.
 I happened to pass through a town one evening and notice costumed children
 wandering door-to-door for candy; thereafter I was aware of the date, irrelevan

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought of Edward several times a minute, flipping through every memory
 I had of him, as though I could fix them more securely in my heart by rehearsin

 I forced more detail out of the fuzzy human recollections than I'd bothered
 with when I'd first gone through my notes.
 Every last time he'd touched me.
 Every single kiss.
 Every word he'd spoken.
 Every expression that had crossed his face.

Elspeth occupied my thoughts, too, but I did less remembering and more speculati

 voice like, when she uttered words? Did Emmett toss her into the air to
 make her laugh? What would Esme see now, if she watched her dream? Did
 she get along with Tanya and Kate and Carmen and Eleazar and David? Was
 Irina still there, or had she broken off from the coven? Which house was
 she living in, which room held my baby when she slept...?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I needed money to get my ring repaired and to replace the chain of my locket
 and repair the bracelet.
 It was also limiting my movement that I didn't have any shoes; I didn't
 need them for comfort, but their absence did attract attention.
 That made the shoes a more urgent problem than the ring.
 The lack of hair -- new growth just barely fuzzing back into existence
 -- was already more oddness that would be ideal; I was glad for Sue's scarf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was November.
 Anyone would remark on my lack of shoes.
 I found a five dollar bill on the ground in a town in Idaho that I passed

\begin_layout Standard
A week later, I stopped at a random, medium-sized town in Montana, on a
 snowy afternoon.
 I knocked on a few doors in a suburb, offering to shovel driveways and
 sidewalks.
 I looked seventeen; it was a plausible occupation, requiring no

 One old lady worried over my lack of a coat.
 I told her I didn't need one, that I'd keep warm doing the shoveling, but
 she insisted that I take her granddaughter's old parka, and I did, not
 wanting to argue or get more attention over my unseasonable attire.
 I shoveled snow until it got dark and people stopped answering their doors,
 accumulating just under a hundred dollars in the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the very end of November, I got to Chicago.
 I didn't know exactly where in the city Edward had grown up.
 I walked up and down every street, half-expecting one block to feel different,

 Eventually I'd covered everything that could reasonably be called

 No place felt unusual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shoveled more snow.
 I didn't visit any home twice.
 I picked a jeweler's when I'd saved up enough money.
 They replaced the chain, and were able to slightly improve the bracelet.
 The ring wasn't as good as new when they finished with it, but at least
 it was wearable.
 I had both of my rings back, the rings he'd given me.
 My hand felt better.

I walked to Florida.
 As I went south, I had to be more careful about when I was in public --

 I was in Jacksonville by Christmas.

I went to my mother's address, in the middle of the night, but there was

 That was good.
 She should be with family.

 Especially now that she thought I was dead.
 I logged in and looked at all her correspondence with Charlie over the
 last couple months.
 Apparently Carlisle 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 eventually gotten in touch with Charlie.
 That was good; that meant that Carlisle was okay.
 The Volturi hadn't killed everyone I'd ever associated with out of spite.
 RenÃ©e didn't get the real story, naturally.
 But she'd been thoroughly convinced that I was dead.
 Apparently they'd held a funeral for me in Forks, and RenÃ©e and Phil had
 gone, but no Cullens had attended.
 Charlie thought it was disgraceful that they hadn't shown up.
 I couldn't blame them, though.

I had no other locations I wanted to visit at all.

 I shoveled driveways when I needed money to replace my clothes, and to
 save extra cash in case I couldn't think of any replacement work for warmer

It occurred to me in mid-January that I didn't really know what Elspeth

 She might not be in Denali anymore.
 Carlisle was unharmed by the Volturi, or he wouldn't have been able to
 contact Charlie.
 They could probably move around freely.
 Maybe they were living in one of their own houses by now.
 I'd only seen Norway, QuÃ©bec, and Forks, but there were more.
 I knew where they were.
 I supposed I'd need to steer clear of those towns.
 They could buy a new house, but I was unlikely to stumble on it.

I walked up the east coast.
 There was a Cullen house in Maine, but it was in Farmington, not close

I walked into Canada.
 It was easier to cross the border unnoticed on foot than in a car, or rather,

But I couldn't have her.
 I shouldn't let myself even get close to Denali, not when it could put

I got to Dallas in late March.
 I was starting to be able to think about things other than my dead husband

 I went into libraries and bookstores when I passed them, flipped through
 and memorized random books and newspapers and magazines.
 I people-watched.
 I window-shopped, and gingerly doled out the cash I'd saved from shoveling
 snow -- I acquired a nice, durable backpack and slowly filled it with spare
 clothes, and a canteen to fill with water.
 I agreed to take photos for strangers.
 I visited landmarks and eavesdropped on conversations and wished Edward
