\emph on
Daddy

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said again, sure that he would react if he would only 
\emph on
understand the word
\emph default
, if he would make the connection that 
\emph on
he
\emph default
 was my 
\emph on
daddy
\emph default
 and therefore 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 was his 
\emph on
daughter
\emph default
 and he should not look at me like that, like he didn't care, like I could
 be 
\emph on
anybody
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_layout Standard
He shrugged, and rolled his eyes, and looked at Adelaide.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't suppose you'll kill me now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said to her, tonelessly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perhaps,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, like she was dangling a tantalizing treat in front of him.
 Then she fixed her attention on me.
 She had 
\emph on
presence
\emph default
 -- more than she'd had before.
 She announced herself, her personality was leaking through the edges of
 her harmless housewife appearance with the ironic t-shirt.
 It might be my power, but it was my power with the weight of a much older
 person with more varied experiences behind it.
 There was more 
\emph on
to
\emph default
 her.
 Greed and sharp curiosity emanated from her, and a lazy annoyance directed
 at the departed witches, but most of all there was just 
\emph on
depth
\emph default
, the sense that here stood a person who had many years of history and accumulat
ed knowledge.
 
\emph on
Will I shine like that when I'm a hundred? A thousand?
\emph default
 I wondered dizzily.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adelaide smiled at me, not exactly 
\emph on
threateningly
\emph default
, but there were 
\emph on
edges
\emph default
 to it: her indulgence would cover me for the time being and when it ended
 so would I.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aren't 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 interesting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she purred.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dimly, I recognized that if I was interesting, something had gone very badly
 wrong.
 I was not supposed to be interesting.
 Had that had something to do with the nonsense I'd been whispering to myself...?
 That didn't make sense.
 People who said nonsensical things were at least 
\emph on
slightly
\emph default
 interesting.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No ma'am,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, cowed.
 There wasn't a point in trying to get away.
 Even with my harmless power, Adelaide was a vampire and could catch me
 in an instant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
I
\emph default
 think you are,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Adelaide murmured, boring into me with intent eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was going to have a look at you after the witches were fed...
 I suppose you knew your father was here?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was the part where I was supposed to be picked up and carried away
 by...
 someone...
 and that wasn't happening, and 
\emph on
why
\emph default
 would Daddy want Adelaide to kill him? Why wouldn't he want to run out
 of the city at top speed and find Mama
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy's eyes flicked back to me with the first sign of interest they'd shown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adelaide noticed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it, Edward?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she inquired.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know Chelsea and I were very thorough.
 She doesn't matter to you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was one thing Chelsea couldn't break, though
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

-- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
MAMA IS ALIVE
\emph default
, I screamed in my head as hard as I could.
 I could see Daddy's eyes widen, and Adelaide said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come here, Edward, don't annoy me or I'll decide not to kill you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and she held out her hand
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

-- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy took three steps toward her, then whirled with blinding speed and
 caught me up with one arm around my waist and knocked the wind out of me
 and followed the other escaped witches out of the dungeon and he was so
 fast, faster than Mama, just like she said
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

-- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he didn't care about me a bit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He only wanted me to lead him to her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this was part of the plan, I supposed, that I be picked up and carried
 somewhere, and I was, so I let it happen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow, we didn't run into anyone on our way out of the compound.
 Probably Daddy listening for and avoiding thoughts, and with the other
 witches escaped too everyone would be in a panic and spread thin trying
 to contain them.
 Daddy nodded once when I thought of this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were not as lucky outside the compound -- there were humans everywhere
 and it was full daylight.
 I guessed that he didn't care about secrecy anymore.
 The worst thing that could happen if humans saw a vampire streaking through
 Volterra would be that the Volturi would try to capture him again, to put
 back in the dungeon or just kill, and he didn't plan to let that happen
 with Mama alive.
 (He nodded again.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Mama 
\emph on
probably
\emph default
 alive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he snapped.
 I winced.
 I had only a handful of memories of his voice, and it had sounded different
 then.
 But then, he'd loved me then.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 have gotten away, in New York, but I didn't see...
 but surely someone would have thought of her within Daddy's range if she'd
 been 
\emph on
seen
\emph default
, let alone caught...? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He pursed his lips, but seemed to accept that as evidence for her survival.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
She
\emph default
 loves me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I tried.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm 
\emph on
her
\emph default
 daughter.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He glanced down a little, probably to look at my eyes that Mama says are
 like the ones she had before turning, but then paid attention to where
 he was going again with a small shake of his head.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You aren't 
\emph on
her
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where are we going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked after a moment.
 We were almost out of the city, and the shouts of confused humans were
 thinning.
 I wondered what they'd think of us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm trying to catch up with Alice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aunt Alice is alive too?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I exclaimed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes.
 She was in the room with me and I could read her, so Chelsea gave up on
 trying to cut off my affection for her, but I didn't have any way to communicat
e 
\emph on
back
\emph default
.
 I was working on convincing Addy to relay messages to her for me when you
 sprung us.
 Alice might or might not help.
 She's still the best chance of finding Bella if you don't know where she
 is, although Alice will want to find Jasper first.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's in Nashville, with Peter and Charlotte,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He blinked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were out of the city and into the countryside.
 I put my hand on his cheek and showed him the time Mama told me about meeting
 Uncle Jasper.
 A look of intense sorrow and focus took over his features, like what he
 saw hurt him but pulling away from it would hurt more.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice saw him, of course.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He frowned.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She 
\emph on
ought
\emph default
 to have seen Bella when that happened -- and then I'd have 
\emph on
known
\emph default
 -- but by then she was occasionally looking elsewhere, trying to practice
 the vision sharing she's learned to do on other subjects
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vision sharing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, blinking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There isn't a lot to do in the dungeon,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daddy said dryly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

More so for Alice than me; I could have two-way conversations with Addy,
 if no one else, and I can listen to many voices where Alice sees only one
 thing at a time.
 She learned a new trick.
 But Jasper didn't hold up very well, and the visions weren't helping.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He sounded...
 
\emph on
unimpressed
\emph default
 by me.
 Like he thought that even 
\emph on
with
\emph default
 Chelsea's interference he could have properly cared for some other, better
 daughter if she'd shown up, who knew more and could have guessed about
 Alice without help.
 I searched his face, hoping he'd contradict the thought.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He rolled his eyes at me again and I shrank in towards myself.
 I didn't 
\emph on
like
\emph default
 this, I didn't 
\emph on
like
\emph default
 that Chelsea could just reach in and 
\emph on
steal my father's love
\emph default
.
 Things weren't supposed to work that way.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mama's not going to be happy with you for acting like this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I coaxed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Look,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Daddy impatiently, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 matter to me that you're Bella's daughter and that she loves you, and I'm
 going to look after you for her until we find her again because that's
 what she would want, and Bella is stronger than I am and in the same position
 of course 
\emph on
she
\emph default
 would have continued to love you, but 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 am not immune to Chelsea.
 At the time what she did was even a mercy.
 One less person to agonize over.
 Alice can't see you anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why did the Volturi try to kill Mama, instead of putting her in the dungeon
 too?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy couldn't copy her when she tried,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daddy said shortly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They had no way to control her, and they didn't need 
\emph on
my
\emph default
 cooperation, not with the setup you saw.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He shook his head a little, and his face shone with admiration.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But she was too strong, too committed to life.
 I should have known.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just her shield,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's a power, like mine or yours, it just let her stay alive.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Powers reflect the people who have them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said implacably.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You, for instance, 
\emph on
demand attention
\emph default
 even while I am trying to catch Alice and slowed down by 
\emph on
your
\emph default
 weight.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm going to show Mama 
\emph on
everything
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I snapped.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Every last thing.
 I can't make you love me but you don't have to be 
\emph on
horrible
\emph default
 to me! You're still my 
\emph on
daddy!
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were well into the countryside.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hollered Daddy, and he scowled at me, probably because I'd make him invisible
 to her.
 I felt a hot tear creeping down my cheek.
 Why did I even 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 that stupid jailbreak? Why bother? When I'd...
 somehow...
 gotten past Saeed, why hadn't I just left the compound by myself and gone
 for help that 
\emph on
hadn't
\emph default
 had 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 done to them? I could have probably got to Ireland under my own power,
 even if none of my phone numbers worked, and then I could have tried to
 find Gianna and Maggie and Ilario and gotten new phone numbers if nothing
 else, and then I could have called Grandpa Carlisle and he would have bought
 me a plane ticket and I would have been wherever they were living in less
 than a 
\emph on
day
\emph default
 and nobody would have been the 
\emph on
least bit
\emph default
 horrible to me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt a sudden fear for what Mama would be like, with Daddy back in her
 life.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Did she love me because I was 
\emph on
her
\emph default
 daughter? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or because I was 
\emph on
his
\emph default
? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would she have any use for me with this 
\emph on
jerk
\emph default
 around being 
\emph on
magically bonded to her
\emph default
? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy didn't react to my thoughts this time, not even to roll his eyes.
 I looked ahead, and thought I saw a sparkling shape hurtling away from
 us, but we were gaining.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I shouted, wondering if I'd be harder to ignore.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Either I was better at getting attention or we'd just gotten closer in the
 past second.
 Alice turned her head, but didn't stop running.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They'll use wolves! I'm better at noticing those coming than you are!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 bellowed Daddy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll help you make it to Jasper if you'll help me find Bella after that!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice still didn't stop, but she slowed down a little, and let us catch
 up.
 She looked confused when she got a closer look at me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she guessed, neutrally.
 She had almost no hair left.
 Otherwise she looked just like I remembered her, only without the smile.
 She wore a fiercely determined frown instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, wondering if Alice would be any nicer to me than Daddy.
 I wasn't sure what attitude Chelsea left behind after severing a relationship.
 I might just be seeing how Daddy acted towards strangers, and maybe Alice
 was nicer to strangers than him.
 I couldn't remember Mama having much to say about how Daddy acted towards
 people he had 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 connection with -- the closest would be Gianna and Ilario, and Mama had
 been 
\emph on
there
\emph default
 then and they'd been under the family's protection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Keep back a little,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she told Daddy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She'll get in my way.
 But we can work together.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He fell behind a few paces, but was close enough to talk, if there was
 anything to talk about.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where are we going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked for the second time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was 
\emph on
going
\emph default
 to make for the west coast and swim for it, deep enough that I'd be impossible
 to chase with wolves,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice with a twist of annoyance in her voice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure what to do with you.
 Maybe I should go on my own after all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perhaps I can help,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I noticed, for the first time, that she was running alongside us.
 She was faster than me -- I couldn't have kept up with Daddy, even at the
 reduced speed I forced him down to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello, Allirea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Daddy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've been aware of you -- intermittently -- but obviously haven't had the
 chance to introduce myself.
 My name is Edward Cullen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The mind-reader,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Allirea.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then you know what I want, and what I can give you for it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded once.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Allirea's power is to fade from notice.
 It extends to anything that she's doing.
 If she carries us on an airplane in luggage, no one will pay attention
 to any of us as long as we're hidden from sight -- she could conceal one
 of us most of the way in plain view, but not all three, especially not
 Elspeth.
 She's sincere about the offer if we help her with what she wants.
 She wants Demetri killed and can't do it herself, because her power doesn't
 work on him.
 We'll probably need to do that anyway, when he catches up with us -- although
 I think the top recapture priorities will probably be Benjamin and Li-qing,
 maybe Dwi, not us.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice, and they veered right, heading north to what was presumably
 the nearest airport.
 She glanced over her shoulder at Allirea.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I 
\emph on
remember
\emph default
 you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said with a little hiss.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I did not go there willingly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Allirea said, calmly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Demetri was ready to drag me back if I tried to run.
 I could no more escape than you could see me coming.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice glanced at Daddy, and he nodded, and she accepted the excuse.
 She at least trusted Daddy, even if she didn't particularly care about
 him anymore.
 He cared about her, though, probably second-most out of everybody after
 my mama.

I was much farther down the list.

\begin_layout Standard
We waited for Allirea outside a town while she went in to steal suitcases,
 and clothes for Daddy and Alice.
 She was back in a few moments.
 They got dressed, and Alice as the second-strongest and second-fastest
 carried the suitcases, and we continued to the airport.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't try to chat any more during the run to the airport.
 No one else did either, after Alice had described to Allirea where we needed
 to fly.
 When we got there, we hid behind a van in the parking lot and everyone
 but Allirea got into a bag.
 Alice was small enough to fit into a backpack if she scrunched up, which
 she did; Allirea slung the bag over her arms.
 Daddy and I were each in wheeled suitcases.
 I remembered Mama telling me the story of when she'd traveled that way.
 Allirea left my suitcase unzipped enough that I could breathe easily, but
 I still thought Mama had probably been more comfortable this way than I
 had.

Remember,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Allirea said firmly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you are stowing onto an airplane.
 You must not get out of your suitcases.
 You will get where you need to go.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She repeated that a few more times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I was trundling along the ground in my bag, probably being pulled towards
 my plane by a baggage handler or something, and I didn't remember getting
 the label that would send me to the right place, but maybe Daddy had taken
 care of that after I'd gotten in my suitcase and couldn't see what was
 going on...? I stayed put and was glad I wasn't claustrophobic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I smelled the stale odor that airplanes have, and I waited and listened
 to people talking, and eventually I fell asleep.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I woke up, I was still in the suitcase, still on the airplane.
 I had no idea what time it was, or how my sleep schedule was responding
 to all the excitement and changes in time zone.
 Someone had slipped a lot of little packets of peanuts into the bag with
 me while I slept, though, and I had just enough maneuvering room to open
 them and shake them into my mouth one bag at a time.
 They didn't taste very nice, but in sufficient quantity they were filling,
 and I was hungry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The captain announced that we were approaching the Nashville International
 Airport, and it occurred to me to be scared of Uncle Jasper.
 Mama had described him as being absolutely out of his mind, and she'd noticed
 him being wildly moody -- 
\emph on
she
\emph default
 wouldn't have caught it if he were also using his empathy erratically,
 since she was immune, but 
\emph on
we
\emph default
 could.
 I didn't really like the idea of being made to feel random things by a
 mad vampire.
 Maybe I could stay back, or maybe he'd get better instantly when Alice
 went to him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And once we found Jasper it would be time to look for Mama, and I didn't
 know where she was.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were two obvious places we could look for Mama: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One was with the family, whom she might have contacted on the assumption
 that Cody would reveal everything to the Volturi anyway.
 (I didn't think he'd already done it.
 If he had, somebody would have thought of Mama near enough Daddy that he'd
 hear, and if 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 thoughts would get his attention, it would be ones about Mama.
 Cody himself must not even be within a mile of the main compound, I decided.
 It would be too much of a coincidence for him to have thought of her 
\emph on
not once
\emph default
, even with a lot on his mind as he probably had.
 They might keep him and the wolves out of the way so Adelaide could have
 a clear view of the place when she borrowed Alice's power.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other was the rendezvous point in San Francisco.
 She could be hoping that the pack would have gotten away, and me with them,
 or that Jacob would at least have sent me ahead on my own for safety.
 And then, if she'd not contacted the family, she would probably wait there
 for me, because the New York point was blown.
 I had 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 told Cody about the Golden Gate Park one.
 I didn't remember even telling him there 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 one besides the one in Central Park.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I decided that Mama was probably more likely to get hold of the family than
 to just wait in San Francisco.
 With their help she could have someone ready to meet me there -- Aunt Rosalie,
 maybe -- but could also get help against the possibility that I had been
 captured by the Volturi.
 Which I had, but she wouldn't have expected me to get 
\emph on
out
\emph default
 again.
 And she 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 wasn't expecting Daddy or Aunt Alice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't sure where Grandma and Grandpa and Rosalie and Emmett were living,
 though, since they'd surely moved at least once since I'd last been with
 them.
 They called their residences 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

permanent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and often retained the houses for a long time, but tended not to 
\emph on
live
\emph default
 in them for more than four or five years even without a rapidly growing
 half-vampire child.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama wouldn't know where they were either.
 She would have tried all the old phone numbers, but unless one of them
 was the same as it had been before, she wouldn't get ahold of them.
 But even without that, she could have gone to Denali, which really 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 a permanent residence.
 I tried to estimate how long it would have taken her to get there on foot
 from New York, but eventually gave up; it would depend too heavily on how
 careful she thought she needed to be to lose the Volturi contingent.
 She might be there already, she might be on her way, she might be heading
 for California instead, I couldn't know.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I supposed I could just let Daddy be in charge of figuring out how to find
 Mama.
 Whether he liked it or not, he was my parent, and I'd spent the last while
 wishing for a parent to be in charge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't sure I liked the idea anymore, though.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even after we found Mama, having Daddy back could make her really 
\emph on
different
\emph default
, and that scared me.
 Mama hadn't been Chelseaed -- probably 
\emph on
couldn't
\emph default
 be Chelseaed -- but with Daddy around, I wouldn't be her top priority anymore.
 With Daddy around, her life wouldn't revolve exclusively around making
 me safe and happy.
 With Daddy around, she would be 
\emph on
Daddy's wife
\emph default
 before being 
\emph on
my Mama
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then again, the only person whose 
\emph on
indelible
\emph default
 top priority was me was...
 Jacob, and I still wasn't very impressed with him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama had almost certainly gotten away, and could have taken me with her
 if he hadn't 
\emph on
trapped
\emph default
 me because he didn't understand how vampires work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I wouldn't have found Daddy and Alice, but I was having a hard time
 being very pleased that I had.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe Mama would make everything better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or maybe it was time to grow up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plane came in for a bouncy landing.
 My suitcase was pulled out of the plane, and I waited for some sign that
 it was time to get out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the sounds around me, I guessed that I was in the Nashville airport parking
 lot at the time I remembered Allirea existed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can come out now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, and I nudged the zipper on my bag out of the way and unfolded
 with a very welcome stretch, shedding staticky peanut wrappers as I stood.
 The vampires' bags didn't start partly open, so even though they were faster,
 I was out first.
 I watched Alice pop out of her bag in a tremendous hurry, and she hauled
 Daddy out of his when he wasn't quick enough to suit her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea readily abandoned the suitcases, and Daddy picked me up like he
 would have picked up a sack of vegetables and followed his sister out of
 the parking lot.

Daddy fell behind obediently enough, and Alice shot forward.

\begin_layout Standard
Between the two of them, Alice and Daddy were able to avoid our being seen
 by any humans, although there was some leaping between rooftops involved.
 Alice ran like she was possessed.
 We lost sight of her occasionally, although she reined herself in before
 ever getting out of Daddy's mind-reading range.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jasper was sheltering from the daylight in a warehouse that stank of human
 blood, presumably from the last hunt.
 Alice hurtled towards her mate, but stopped short.
 I wondered if he was so convinced she was dead that he might have attacked
 her for an imposter, had she continued and tried to give him a hug.
 As it was, he stared.

 said Peter quietly, frowning at Alice and knitting his dark eyebrows.
 For some reason, he was wearing a suit; trim and urbane, he looked like
 the diametric opposite of crazed Jasper.
 Charlotte, all in denim, was Alice's height, though her riot of frizzy
 yellow-rose curls stood in contrast to my aunt's patches of limp dark hair.
 She nodded at her mate's statement, wide-eyed.
