Prisoner
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I grabbed Pera's arm and pulled her away, but I'm not fast enough to get
 prey out of the path of a vampire, and I think Mama might have killed her.
 Two things prevented that.
 One, Brady -- and the other wolves -- leapt forward as soon as Mama moved,
 and two, Mama checked 
\emph on
herself

, jerking away from the attack.
 The wolves were on her an instant later.

\begin_layout Standard
A grey wolf with white frost to his fur was knocked out of the press of
 the pack against Mama.
 That was Brady, I knew, but I didn't see who'd pushed him aside.
 He snarled, but didn't get up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few more wolves stepped back, until there were only four, each pinning
 one of Mama's limbs with his forepaws.
 Rust-brown Jacob had her right arm, Victor's ochre paws covered her left,
 inky-black Sam and chocolate Quil held a leg each.
 It didn't look like Mama was broken, or if something had been fractured,
 it had knitted at once.
 Mama looked stunned, and wasn't breathing.

I turned to Pera, who was cowering against a tree.
 Brady whined, but must have been commanded to stay down, because he didn't
 get up and go to her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera, you have to unhide her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 Pera shuddered ungracefully, and clearly didn't want to get anywhere near
 Mama as her witchcraft required.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just do it, then it'll be safe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I pleaded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emily approached Pera and helped her up, gently leading her towards Mama.
 Pera gingerly touched one of Mama's feet, poking out from beneath Sam's
 claws, and Mama vanished and the four wolves tipped forward a few inches
 onto the ground.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Brady phased.
 Usually the wolves would trot off behind cover with a set of clothes to
 do that, but they weren't always careful, and I wasn't stunned or scarred
 for life by it after a few days living with the pack.

I couldn't have, and she couldn't either -- but um -- vampires sometimes
 find that a specific person smells much better than others, and Pera was
 bleeding already...
 that's what a `singer' is, a person like that.
 She didn't

 I said, turning to Pera, who was still shivering, and staring at something
 I couldn't see -- probably Mama.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zachary had trotted over towards where the clothes were kept, and he flung
 a pair of pants at Brady, who put them on and went to wrap his arms around
 Pera.
 She leaned on him and didn't speak; he murmured comfort in her ear.

I turned around slowly, bewildered, to see who he was looking at, what other
 comment he'd responded to, but he was looking right at me.

Elspeth, she just attacked Pera.

\begin_layout Standard
I stared at him, waiting for this pronouncement to turn into a terrible,
 badly-timed joke.
 I searched for humor somewhere in his expression, and found none.
 He was only sad -- but firmly resolved anyway.

 He looked like he wanted to kill somebody.
 Mama, probably.

 I whirled around, daring to hope that Pera would disobey Jacob.
 She could.
 It was within her power.
 But there was no mutiny in her eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I turned back to Jacob, forcing my power into an almost-visible channel
 of pleading, but while he still looked terribly sorry to trap me, he didn't
 budge.

\begin_layout Standard
There's only a couple of things I can do that vampires can't, but one of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't let myself cry for long.
 I could at least 
\emph on
write
\emph default
 to Mama.
 I found the pen and the pad of paper, again, and started scribbling.
 
\emph on
Mama, are you still there?
\emph default
 I held up the pen, loosely in my palm, so she could take it if she was.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pen lifted out of my hand, and the pad with it, and Mama wrote back
 in her precise round letters, 
\emph on
I'm still here.
 Is everyone safe? Can you stop hiding?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We're all safe
\emph default
, I wrote, with a glare in Jacob's direction.
 
\emph on
The singer is the same witch who hides and un-hides people.
 Jacob will not let her unhide anyone while you're here because he doesn't
 think you're safe.
 Even me.
 He imprinted on me, Mama,
\emph default
 I added belatedly, wishing I could just 
\emph on
send
\emph default
 her things instead of having to write.
 Writing is even worse than speaking aloud.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama took the pen, but there was a significant pause before she wrote anything.
 
\emph on
Apart from not being free to unhide, are you safe, Elspeth?
\emph default
 she wrote, finally.
 
\emph on
They aren't hurting you or harrassing you or otherwise mistreating you apart
 from that? Jacob isn't pressuring you at all about anything related to
 the imprint?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Besides that, no,
\emph default
 I scrawled back.
 I have very bad handwriting, and being upset wasn't doing anything to improve
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Let's continue writing in a tree, where humans will be less likely to see
 the odd behavior of this pen,
\emph default
 she wrote.
 The pen and paper appeared to float towards and up into the branches of
 a large, thickly-leafed tree, and I followed.
 Once Mama found a place that suited her and had given me a few seconds
 to sit within reach of the writing implements, she wrote, 
\emph on
Do you think there is any chance you can convince Jacob to change his mind,
 or the witch to let you free without his permission?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I don't know.
 Maybe.
 Not soon, though.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Please tell me everything that's happened since we were separated,
\emph default
 Mama wrote.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wrote, haltingly and messily and with the liberal use of margin notes
 and arrows, about how I had spent the last five days and what I'd learned.
 I couldn't see Mama reacting, and I hated it, not knowing how she was taking
 anything I wrote, not knowing if she was disappointed in me for telling
 all the secrets or for kissing Cody, not knowing if she was angry at Jacob
 or at Cody or at Pera, not knowing whether she would frown at my summary
 of the Clearwater children's dialogue or smile at my listing of everyone
 in the pack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually I brought her up to speed, as best I could without being able
 to show her anything, and she plucked the pen out of my hand and wrote
 
\emph on
You've had quite a week, Elsie.
 And I'm not at all convinced that you're safe with the pack as Jacob suggests.
 Not with the Volturi impatient and willing to get 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

creative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If his motive is really your safety, and it probably is, he can be convinced
 to let you go.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wrote, 
\emph on
What do you think they'll do?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I don't know for sure,
\emph default
 she replied.
 
\emph on
It's obvious that the Volturi haven't been trying to 
\bar under
kill
\bar default
 the pack members.
 That wouldn't be difficult.
 Things like setting the trees on fire are easy to escape, if it's only
 a few trees.
 They could have timed it differently so the camp would be ringed with fire
 and harder to escape.
 There has been nothing stopping them from attacking with poison gas or
 just getting hold of a bomb and setting that off.
 They've probably been trying to keep Pera alive, and have only harassed
 the pack to try to tempt them into giving up.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That hadn't occurred to me.
 There were really a 
\emph on
lot
\emph default
 of indirect, object-based attacks that could go from outside into the hiding
 place.
 The fact that the pack was alive -- with no casualties -- after half a
 decade 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 seem to mean that the Volturi hadn't wanted them dead.
 
\emph on
Do you think that's the sort of thing they'll try now?
\emph default
 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Maybe, maybe not.
 There are other things they could try; I doubt they'd give up a gift like
 Pera's readily.
 Send Heidi wandering by and lead Pera where they want her, maybe, since
 you said Pera can see people whether they're hidden or not.
 The only reason I can think of why they wouldn't have tried Chelsea already
 would be if Chelsea can't work across the divide, like you.
 Perhaps Heidi can't either, but that seems less likely.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
But Chelsea can't work on imprinting relationships any more than she can
 on vampire mates, can she?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
She can't work on the wolves.
 I'm given to understand that it has no effect on the imprints themselves,
 who would accordingly be vulnerable.
 Did you notice some effect?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
No,
\emph default
 I wrote.
 
\emph on
I don't think anything happened to me.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Then it's unlikely that anything happened to the other imprints either.
 Chelsea should be able to work on them as well as anyone else.
 Perhaps she has to see who she's affecting, or something like that.
 I wish I could ask Eleazar.

\emph default
 The pen paused in its path, tapped twice on the pad, and then wrote, 
\emph on
You are almost certainly right about Cody being likely to have his mind
 read, and that means my survival is going to be known to the Volturi.
 As long as that's the case, perhaps I may as well tell the family.
 In any case, we should get out of New York.
 They'll know to look for us here if we're at all interesting to them.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Why would they want Cody?
\emph default
 I wrote.
 
\emph on
They probably didn't just suddenly decide to let his brother and sister
 talk to him to be nice.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Probably not
\emph default
, Mama agreed.
 
\emph on
My best guess is they didn't want the pack to be able to turn Pera.
 Her power could expand considerably if she turned.
 Even if it was the same, she wouldn't need sleep -- or die of old age or
 minor injury or illness.
 It could make them permanently, 
\bar under
actually
\bar default
 safe, instead of just temporarily inconvenient.
 Also, if she died she'd be forever unavailable to the Volturi.
 Based on how long they waited before killing Alice and your father, they
 can be patient, but Alice and your father were vampires.
 Cody was the only venomous person in the group.

\emph default
 It was strange, reading Mama's writing about Daddy without the sadness
 I associated with it.
 Her penmanship didn't falter, but I could imagine her face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Should I show this conversation to Jacob?
\emph default
 I frowned to myself, resentful of him and inclined to petulantly deny him
 my presence.
 But if he could be convinced to let Pera unhide me, then that was more
 important than punishing him for having refused in the first place.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Yes.
 You might also mention to him that I was a singer, and survived.
 Control is possible.
 If Pera had not had a papercut, or if I'd been expecting her to be a singer,
 I wouldn't have attacked.
 There is 
\bar under
absolutely no
\bar default
 danger to you if you unhide, even if you smell as much like her as is physicall
y possible.
 I will 
\bar under
never
\bar default
 hurt you, Elspeth.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I know that,

 I wrote, a mulish expression on my face.

 I'm sure there are plenty I didn't hear of.

Brady drew in a sharp breath between his teeth and placed a hand over Pera's

 She didn't protest, just leaned against him more and shivered.

Heidi wasn't involved.

There were nets, first, shot out of the sort of net-shooting gun that I

 The nets were made of knitted links of metal that couldn't hold the werewolves,
 but 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 slow them down long enough for what must have been the smoke of a burnt
 vampire to knock them all out.
 There were more than enough nets, probably to compensate for our invisibility,
 and I was knocked off Jacob's back with the force of the one that caught
 me in the back.
 I clawed at it and couldn't tear it.
 But with concerted effort, I could bite through individual fibers of the
 net, one at a time, slowly.
 I nibbled at it as unobtrusively as I could, trying to ignore the unpleasant
 tang of the metal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't tell how many Volturi were involved in the capture, but it had
 to be a lot.
 I saw Pera trying to hide the net one piece at a time to get through it
 the way she'd get through a hotel door.
 Surprisingly, no one interfered with this, but once she'd gotten a hole

I think I was knocked out until the time at which I'd naturally sleep, and
 then I slept, because otherwise I don't know how I got all the way to Italy
 without waking up.
 When I woke, I was in a strange sort of cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were a usual number of walls, made of a usual sort of stone.
 But they were all sufficiently concave that I couldn't bite into them,
 or at least not readily; the floor was the same, which made it kind of
 uncomfortable to sit on because I kept sliding into the middle if I didn't
 pay attention and brace myself in a corner.
 There was a door, and it had a tiny square of a window that let in a beam
 of light, but it had a little sign on it that said

 I leaned back against the rock, put my hand against my face, and tried

I didn't make any progress.

 I didn't do it on purpose.
 I don't like being hungry at all.

I thought perhaps there was a guard outside the cell.
 Except for the since-healed strike to my head, I hadn't been injured any
 further.
 Whatever they wanted might not preclude feeding me.
 Giving the maybe-electric door a considerable berth, I called,

 the vampire's face.

 either.

 He looked afraid, but there was a glazed look in his eyes like he was still
 dwelling on the memory of what Heidi looked like when she turned her power
 up.
 I assumed the beautiful angel was Heidi, anyway.

But she shone like a jewel, like a

 exclaimed Carlo dazedly.
 I wasn't sure if his failure to get the point that Heidi's prettiness didn't
 make her a good person was more to do with her power or his personality,
 or some combination of both.
 I was treated to an overwrought description of Heidi's every feature --
 he claimed her eyes were 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

amethyst
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, which was an odd choice for a contact lens color; maybe half-melted blue
 ones showing a little red through? -- and after a few minutes he started
 screaming, which was a bit odd.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I peered at him.
 He looked like he was in pain, but I hadn't hurt him, he hadn't touched
 the door, I would have heard if he'd hit himself against the stone of the
 cell...
 I supposed he could have had a heart attack, but that didn't seem likely
 in someone his age.
 The drops of his blood perfuming the air didn't have any scent of disease
 on them.
 It was peculiar, really.
 The 
\emph on
only

 thing that had happened to him since he'd started his description of Heidi
 was that the stranger in the cell had sunk her teeth into his neck and
 started sucking his blood.

What's wrong?

 I finally thought to ask, but he seemed as confused as I and just gestured
 jerkily at his throat.
 A few seconds passed, and he stopped screaming.
 I touched his wrist and checked his pulse.
 He was definitely dead.
 Maybe he'd had a heart attack after all.
 It wasn't

 for teenagers, and he was under a lot of stress.
 That wouldn't have anything to do with his neck, though -- as far as I
 know.
 I'm not a doctor.

I puzzled over this for a few seconds, and then abruptly, the stranger in
 the cell stopped being unimportant.
 I swiveled my head and looked at her.
