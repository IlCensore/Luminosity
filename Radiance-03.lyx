Want a rundown of who's who in the pack, or would you rather let them all
 introduce themselves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody asked me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How many people are there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eight wolves total,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

six imprints, four squirts, and me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eight wolves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought it started with Jacob, Jared, Victor, Quil, Sam, and Darren, and
 then I guess you explained Brady when you explained Pera -- who's number
 eight?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's Zachary,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He wasn't activated in the first wave, and he wasn't in La Push when the
 Volturi started kidnapping and killing people -- nobody could get him to
 drop by for a visit.
 He was in Albuquerque.
 We got to him before the kept wolves did.
 Jake made me lick his nose so he'd activate.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I giggled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think I know about all the imprints...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Might know their names, but what's that without the color commentary?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Cody lightly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You met Pera, she's Brady's girl like I said.
 `Pera' is short for `Esperanza' and she's from Mexico and she taught everybody
 Spanish, but except for the shorties and me and Brady, they suck at it.
 The other wolves can't even borrow Brady's fluency, because wouldn't you
 know, they're only telepathic when they can't talk.
 I guess he can understand stuff for them when they're all wolves, but they
 can't speak more than a few phrases really.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So you know English and Spanish and what else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Smatterings of Quileute -- nobody in the pack really 
\emph on
speaks
\emph default
 the stuff, but we have a few words.
 About six sentences worth of French that Thea remembered from high school.
 You?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fluent in English, Spanish, American Sign Language, Norwegian, Portuguese
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody was looking at me strangely.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Marie taught me all the languages she -- ever learned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, carefully dancing around the tense problem with 
\emph on
knows
\emph default
 versus 
\emph on
knew
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Italian, French, Ukrainian.
 Conversational but not really fluent in Finnish and Swedish and Gaelic.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't be surprised if the parents and Quil are all over you to teach their
 spawn and imprint, respectively,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody, impressed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You said there are four...
 children?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 I assumed that was the meaning of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

squirts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spawn
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah.
 Maureen and Victor have a toddler and a newborn, Ruth and Natalie.
 If you want Maureen to love you forever, offer to babysit.
 She's a great mom but her kids are a handful.
 And Sam and Emily have Paige, and Darren and Thea have Noah -- those are
 almost a year old each, born really close together.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But Claire's young too, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Technically she's older than you or I.
 Isn't that weird?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he remarked, shaking his head.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, Claire you could almost mistake for one of the anklebiters.
 But she's an imprint, and she bosses her Quil around like he's a stuffed
 animal.
 Emily's her aunt and I got Claire to call her `Auntie Em' and Emily still
 hasn't trained her out of it, it's really cute.
 Emily's Sam's imprint, of course.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sam used to be engaged to your sister, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 I hadn't encountered anything that disconfirmed the version of history
 Mama had told me, but it was good to check.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody sobered when I brought up his sister.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said quietly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, Leah and Sam used to be engaged.
 And Emily's her cousin and they were really close until Sam imprinted.
 I know more about my sister from them than from anybody else.
 Or at least how things were with her before...
 stuff happened.
 I include myself in the category of happening stuff,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, a little of the original frivolity returning.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's me, I'm a happening guy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can tell,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, smiling a little.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do...
 you prefer if I not bring up your family?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He shook his head; the motion was energetic enough to toss his ponytail
 over one shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, it's fine.
 My parents are dead vampires, my brother and sister are kept wolves, and
 that's...
 not going to get any worse if you talk about it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, but I changed the subject anyway.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jared and Kim are together, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right, but Kim hasn't got the baby-crazies, or not yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody replied, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

so it's just the pair of them.
 It was sort of funny.
 Maureen decided she wanted a baby, once we were pretty sure we were safe
 hiding with Pera.
 Ruth got born, delivered by a midwife that Pera hid and Victor bullied
 into helping.
 And then suddenly Emily and Thea wanted babies too, like it's contagious.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But not Kim, or Pera,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 Quil was out of the question; his imprint was seven years old.
 And human.
 Mama had explained to me how this was supposedly not something to be concerned
 about, and I 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 believe her, but it would have been more convincing if Quil had an actual
 girlfriend in addition to his imprint, which he apparently didn't.
 His options 
\emph on
were
\emph default
 nonexistent, though, under the circumstances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, not them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was basically raised by the whole pack, but Kim did more than anybody
 else.
 So she either hated the experience and never wants to be a mom for real,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a self-deprecating smirk, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

or I was such a fantastic child that she thinks no human baby could ever
 compare and she'd be inevitably disappointed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I laughed, and he added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think Pera might want kids, but there's no good way to tell if that'd
 interfere with her witchcraft, and, well, having a kid is a little dangerous.
 Maureen and the others can take the chance for themselves, but we'd all
 be in serious trouble if Pera were in a bad way.
 I mean, if she were even just laid up for a couple of weeks, there goes
 our inconspicuous theft.
 I haven't actually talked to her about it, but that's what I think's going
 on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's sad,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said quietly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We rely on Pera a 
\emph on
lot
\emph default
, and it's sort of hard on her.
 She never unhides, either.
 Do me a favor and be her friend, at least till we get to New York? You're
 the only new person she's met in a long time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll try, but -- why doesn't she ever unhide?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mmm...
 okay, I'll tell you her story since she hates telling it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So Pera's nineteen years old and hanging out in Mexico, living her life,
 practicing witchcraft in her spare time, right? And this vampire lady finds
 her and says `nice to meet you, I'm Del, I'm a vampire, I can copy powers,
 would you object terribly if I copied yours because it's new and interesting?'
 Pera never met a vampire before that, she didn't know what to think, but
 she let Del copy her power and they hung out and were basically friends
 for a few weeks.
 Del's actually the one who helped Pera be as skilled a witch as she is
 now.
 They practiced together and bounced ideas off each other and stuff.
 Before Pera met Del she could only hide herself, not other people and certainly
 not objects.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Del was the friend who betrayed her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right in one.
 Del got bored after a few weeks of being friends with Pera, and left, and
 Pera went back to hanging out in Mexico and living her life etcetera.
 And then skip forward six years, Pera's twenty-five and still hanging out
 in Mexico, and who should come knocking but Del.
 Pera 
\emph on
trusted
\emph default
 Del.
 But as soon as she let Del touch her to copy the power again, Del's like
 `gotcha, I work for the Volturi now and I'm taking you to them so they
 can brainwash you and turn you into a vampire.' And since they had the same
 power then, Pera couldn't just hide to get away.
 She's human; without the hiding advantage she couldn't do anything Del
 didn't let her do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So Del brought her back to Volterra, and Pera wasn't bothering to hide since
 it wouldn't help, so Brady could see her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Del did the whole supervillain-reciting-the-evil-plot thing on the way to
 Italy from Mexico.
 So Pera knew about the wolves and she was able to react pretty fast once
 Brady started giving her 
\emph on
imprint face
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Imprint face?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'll see it when you see a wolf and his imprint together.
 It's pretty distinctive.
 It's this look they get in their eyes, really focused and intense and tender.
 Says, 
\emph on
you are the center of the universe and I worship the ground you walk on
 and your wish is my command and I will defend you with my life
\emph default
.
 It'd be corny if they weren't so 
\emph on
sincere
\emph default
 about it.
 I'd compare it to vampire mates, but I do remember my parents, and they
 didn't 
\emph on
stare
\emph default
 at each other like that.
 So either it's different basic stuff, or vampires just don't have the face
 to go with it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Huh.
 So Brady gave her `imprint face', and then -- let me guess.
 She told him she wanted out, and he defected packs and she hid him and
 he was able to clobber Del well enough that they could get out?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Close.
 Everybody was unhidden at the time, Pera told Brady what she wanted, and
 he threw Del 
\emph on
at
\emph default
 another vampire.
 Her copying thing is involuntary -- whenever she touches a witch, she gets
 their power, she doesn't have to do it on purpose,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was still really lucky that he was able to catch her off guard, though.
 So she lost Pera's power and got someone else's, and before she could get
 it back, Pera hid herself and Brady.
 Del couldn't touch Pera to steal her power again, so the rest of the trip
 to join up with the pack was pretty simple.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was? It doesn't seem like it would be,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Demetri could tell where they were -- even if the Volturi couldn't directly
 capture them, couldn't they down their plane or sink their boat or whatever?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They didn't think of that until they'd already snuck onto a plane,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and it landed okay and the pack was there to meet them and get hid too.
 We think the Volturi were hoping to find some way to get Pera still, and
 didn't want to kill her.
 Since then they've tried a few times to do us in that way -- they set trees
 near us on fire and stuff.
 But we've always been able to get to safety in time.
 Wolves are fast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That made sense.
 The Volturi put up with my aunt Alice not working for them for a long time,
 because they thought eventually they could get her to change her mind.
 When that didn't work, they killed her.
 But Pera was able to keep herself and the whole pack pretty safe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is Pera the only witch in the pack?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unless one of the midgets grows up and learns to shoot lasers out of his
 or her eyes, yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody says.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Far as I know there are no witch wolves, and the imprints are all basic
 humans, and I'm the least interesting half-vampire you'll ever meet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There are only six of us,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I pointed out.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You could still be very interesting.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, there might be a whole colony of half-vampires in Bermuda or something
 and we wouldn't know, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But if they're there, I guarantee you, every one of them is more interesting
 than me.
 Fascinating bunch, the hypothetical Bermudan half-vampires.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I giggled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where do I fall in this interestingness spectrum?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm interested,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come on, I've been telling you the ins and outs of everything to do with
 my dull and boring self and social circle, you tell me something.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to.
 I 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 wanted to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama says that powers depend on and interact with how their witches think
 about them.
 In a way, Mama's power and my power and Daddy's are all opposites of each
 other.
 Mama keeps her mind to herself, and that's how she likes it.
 Daddy could read everybody else's (except Mama's).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I can share mine.
 I 
\emph on
want
\emph default
 to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I 
\emph on
want
\emph default
 to tell everybody I meet everything.
 I want everybody to know who I am and what I'm like.
 When I was really little, I could sort of do that.
 I could show my family memories, and later I learned to attach feelings,
 and a couple of months later I could show them things I'd only imagined.
 I still had to be discreet with the neighbors, but at least there were
 a few people I didn't have to keep secrets from.
 It seemed to plateau there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think the only reason my power got any better after that was because Mama
 picked me up and suddenly I had only one person I could be totally honest
 with.
 My power sometimes seems like a second person living in my head, and that
 second person wants to talk to more people, tell them more things, hide
 less, share more, misdirect less.
 It's like it was throwing variations of itself at me, hoping to find something
 I could use with people besides Mama safely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I plateaued again when I was four, and got the hang of letting my power
 pick my words so people wouldn't misunderstand me.
 That's something I can use with anyone.
 Have to, actually, unless I lie outright.
 But it still doesn't cooperate all that much when I'm holding back or using
 a nickname or leaving things out.
 
\end_layout

Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Cody.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh -- sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm trying to think of -- of what to tell you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Take your time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, sounding amused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's such a weighty question, after all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why 
\emph on
shouldn't
\emph default
 I tell him everything? Pera could hide him from the Volturi.
 He didn't want to hurt me.
 He was friendly and helpful and nice and the only person of my own species
 I'd ever met.
 Why 
\emph on
shouldn't
\emph default
 I just reach over and put my hand on his face and let him have it and not
 be cooped up inside myself? I wouldn't see Mama again until I got to New
 York or even longer if I got there first, she was always my outlet for
 this but she wasn't 
\emph on
there
\emph default
...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second person in my head was kicking and screaming and demanding attention.
 
\emph on
I want to talk to someone
\emph default
, I could imagine her wailing.
 
\emph on
I'm so lonely.
 It doesn't count if you do it with words, I want to 
\emph default
show
\emph on
 things to someone, I want to do it 
\emph default
right.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm a witch,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said softly after a lengthy silence.

\begin_layout Standard

Cody wasn't used to it like Mama was.
 He hadn't spent a solid month watching every memory of my early life go
 by like she had when she was catching up.
 He hadn't watched all of my dreams for the past five years.
 He didn't have quite a vampire's processing speed.

I tried to start gently, not dropping him into the middle of my life without
 explanation.
 I offered up stuff I can remember from when I was a baby.
 That isn't a secret from anyone, really.
 So sharing it 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 have suffered the same limitations as when I did something sneaky like
 going by `Anna', which is part of my real name but not all of it.
 But it didn't, I could feel it.
 I wasn't holding back, I was just starting at the beginning.
 I'd pretty much decided that I wasn't going to hide from Cody, even if
 Mama wouldn't have approved.

 I almost pulled my hand away, afraid I'd upset him somehow, and the second

 He put his own hand up to hold mine in place.

 he admitted.

Showing you the abridged story of my life.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Mama hadn't wanted the abridged version, when she'd found me.
 She'd wanted every single waking second, all its detail intact.
 It had taken as long to share it with her as it had to live through, but
 there was less to see then and we spread it out.
 I didn't expect to be transmitting to Cody for the next five and a half
 years, though, so I was letting my power decide what it most urgently wanted
 me to share.
 It was fast-forwarding, compressing similar moments into summaries, glossing
 over repetitive bits as needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even so, it was averaging ten minutes per day I recounted.
 By the time I'd gotten to the part where I was on the plane to Alaska from
 my birthplace, the sun had gotten quite a bit higher in the sky.
 Cody's stomach grumbled loudly.

I let my arm fall to my side, and he let out a little breath as though he'd

You didn't eat anything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.
 I was pretty hungry too.
 My popcorn and granola bar had only taken the edge off.
 Solid food isn't as satisfying as blood, weight for weight, and I hadn't
 had much.

He shook his head a little, to clear it more than to communicate.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said,

is true.
 Not that I couldn't have forgotten about it for another couple hours to
 keep watching -- and hearing and whatnot.
 You're obviously the

 Wow.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
I grinned, thrilled at having gotten to finally let my power do what it
 was supposed to do and at getting such an appreciative reception.
 I wished I could purr.
 I didn't have the same vocal equipment as a vampire, and couldn't, but
 it would have been so appropriate.
 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I guess we should probably hunt, huh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

 he said, but neither of us moved.

\begin_layout Standard
We stood there, alone together in the forest, and then suddenly Cody leaned
 forward and kissed me right on the mouth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a swift, impulsive thing, and he seemed to change his mind three-quarters

It seemed called for.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked, not sure what to make of the kiss at all.
 I wasn't sure if I should be thinking

\begin_layout Standard
I was not

 I was awfully hungry.
 Cody had a big, goofy grin on his face when I pulled back.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Let's hunt,

 I said, vaguely aware that I was smiling in a probably-silly way too.

\begin_layout Standard
We took down a pair of deer and drank up.
 We split the meat from his kill, since the wolves couldn't eat anything

 My deer they could eat, since I was venom-free, and a couple of the wolves
 had a taste for raw meat.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Darren especially,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's gone as long as a week at a time without eating anything we got from
 a store.
 I'm not sure if that's because he actually likes eating deer for breakfast,
 lunch, and dinner, or if he's just especially guilty about all the stealing,
 but he'll probably call dibs on the food.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I made to sling the deer over my shoulders, but Cody picked it up first.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I got it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, grinning.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm surprised enough that you managed to get fed without messing up your
 hair; carrying a deer on your back all that way would definitely break
 your hot streak.

\begin_layout Standard
I tossed my hair; heavy waves of it flounced into the air and drifted back
 down.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's probably full of snarls.
 You just can't tell because it's so wavy to begin with that it all looks
 like part of the normal texture.
 It's really annoying, actually.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

If you don't like it, why don't you cut it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked, adjusting the deer and striking out for camp with me at his heels.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not that I advocate the plan.
 Even if it's really full of snarls it's pretty awesome hair.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
I was momentarily paralyzed by the question.
 Yeah, I'd decided to tell him everything and damn Mama's rules -- but if
 I brought up Mama when I wasn't ready to have a couple hours of conversation
 and show-and-tell about her, it would be really awkward; he thought she
 was dead, after all.
 Would he mind very much if I saved it for later? Could my power put up
 with a few more incomplete weasel-sentences after having been promised
 honesty?

Well, you could keep it in a braid or something if it gets in your way,

 I braid my hair sometimes and it's only a little past my shoulders,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sometimes I do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied.
 Mama actually braided my hair for me more days than not.
 But when we went to a town we planned to stay in for a while, I always
 started presenting myself with my hair down and then changed a few days
 later.
 Over a month 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 don't grow noticeably too much, anymore, but my hair does; switching styles
 a few times makes that less obvious, or at least Mama thinks so.
 That's why I had my hair down, two days after coming to Kora's town.

But I'm not good at braiding my own hair because I can't see what I'm doing.

That's Thea.
 Staring at her is Darren -- hey, man, want this deer? Certified free of
 vampire juice, here you go -- and spitting up on her shoulder is their
 little Noah.
 Sam and Emily are over by the rock, trying to get Paige to say `dada'.
 You saw Quil, but he was furrier at the time; that's Claire sitting on
 his shoulders pretending he's a spaceship.
 Victor and Maureen are chasing Ruth over there, and looks like Kim is holding
 Natalie for them, and Jared is the one next to her tying his shoes -- I
 guess they just got back, or he forgot to put on shoes again.
 Zachary's there with Brady and Pera, boring them with...

\begin_layout Standard
I caught up to Cody's introductions, looking at and memorizing each face,
 and finally looked at Jacob.
 Like all the wolves, he was a big guy -- six foot seven, at a guess, and
 made of muscle, and looked twenty-five even though I knew he was really
 at least four years short of that.
 It was subtle, but everyone oriented themselves around him: he was clearly
 in charge, and the pack, wolves in particular, were ready to drop what
 they were doing and obey him if he said
