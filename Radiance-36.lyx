Mrs.

 exclaimed Genevieve, getting up and shuffling to the door, leaving me and
 Rosalie and Emmett frozen in astonishment.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wasn't expecting you tonight! Come in, come in.
 You too, Mr.
 Whitlock.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mrs.
 Whitlock?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I repeated.
 That was Jasper's last name from when he'd been human.
 I supposed they might have ditched the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Cullen

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hale

 names, no longer needing to masquerade as an unmarried couple adopted separatel

 I listened, and did hear another person breathing, besides Alice and Genevieve.
 Alice and Jasper both, then, and anyone else too far off for me to hear
 or holding their breath...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Elspeth, Mr.
 Hale, Mrs.
 Hale, this is Alice Whitlock,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Genevieve introduced brightly, leading Alice into the room with Jasper
 trailing warily behind them.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

And her husband Jasper Whitlock.
 Alice, Jasper, these are

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We've met,

 said Alice delicately.
 Her posture was relaxed, but I knew that she didn't need to be in a combative
 stance to fight circles around

\begin_layout Standard
Anyone she could

 So, if I were casting enough of a shadow, we might not automatically all
 die if she or Jasper decided to attack.
 Unless there were other Volturi lying in wait outside.
 Which there might be.
 I shivered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice caught and held eye contact with me.
 I noted with some mild relief that her eyes were dark gold, and so were
 Jasper's...
 but that didn't necessarily signify any other break from the Volturi.
 Nobody would care if a couple eccentric vampires in the guard wanted to
 dine on animals.
 The fact that they did want to would have been more inspiring, if it weren't
 for the fact that Alice had started down the path without Cullen help and
 had no reason to consider vegetarianism equivalent to being a member of
 the family.
 I couldn't assume that their gold eyes meant anything more than a continuation
 of that independent habit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, you know each other! My goodness!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Genevieve, making an effort to sound pleased, but the fact that this
 was not a friendly chance encounter was obvious, and her voice was strained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Rosalie said, eyeing Alice and Jasper uncomfortably.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

Ms.
 Patterson, how did you meet Alice and Jasper?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why, they're doing research on my mother -- they're doing a project for
 a museum exhibit on the history of women in the armed forces,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 explained Genevieve.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mother was an army nurse.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Rosalie, flat-voiced.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's lovely.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Genevieve, anxiously looking between Alice and Jasper, and me and
 Rosalie and Emmett.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I...
 I wasn't expecting you, Alice, Jasper.
 You said you would next come tomorrow morning.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Something came up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Jasper muttered, exchanging a calculating look with Emmett.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't understand,

 Genevieve said.

Elspeth

 said Rosalie.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Don't,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 interrupted Alice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why not?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 I wasn't sure what Rosalie had been about to instruct me to say, but Alice
 seemed to at least have a guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't 
\emph on
what?
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Genevieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because they'll be able to find out where we went, and check,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Genevieve was still bewildered, but with a decent guess of who 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

they
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 were, I surmised she meant that knowledge of what was going on would be
 dangerous for Genevieve.
 At least Alice was still capable of wanting Genevieve not to be murdered
 for knowing too much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They don't 
\emph on
know
\emph default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Emmett asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is going on?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 exclaimed Genevieve, starting to look a little shaky.
 She lowered herself into her chair, gazing around between her five visitors
 with unnerved eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's all right, Genevieve,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 soothed Alice, not taking her eyes off my group.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perhaps we should discuss our own topics somewhere else, rather than continuing
 to impose on your hospitality.
 Rosalie? Emmett? Elspeth? Is that agreeable?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The little island due north of here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suggested Emmett, not letting her choose the location.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Should be empty.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Very well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jasper.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good day,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he added to Genevieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't understand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pleaded the old woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please don't worry about it, Genevieve,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and I followed the vampires out of the house.
 I wanted to tell her it was okay, but she wouldn't have believed it.
 I didn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We made our way to the little island, awkwardly.
 None of us wanted to drop our guard, so we left our car where we'd parked
 it and traveled on foot, shifting configuration from defensive formation
 to defensive formation every three steps but never making an openly hostile
 move.
 Rosalie and Emmett made sure that neither of the others had a clear path
 to me, and Jasper and Alice seemed to be silently arguing over who got
 to protect the other.
 I didn't notice any sign of (other) Volturi.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quick swim halfway across the Black Bay later, we were on the designated
 island.
 (I was reminded of the time my mother conveyed me across Lake Huron when
 she first found me, although this time I made the trip under my own power;
 Rosalie and Emmett kept pace with me and hung close, and Alice and Jasper
 kept pace with 
\emph on
them
\emph default
 but swum a hundred feet off to our left.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we'd all pulled ourselves out of the water (Emmett shook himself off
 like a dog, and Rosalie carefully wrung her hair out), Emmett said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, again: They don't know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll tell you that story if you tell us -- let's make that, if Elspeth tells
 us -- what you're doing here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go ahead, Elsie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Rosalie, shifting to interpose part of herself between me and
 a flinty-eyed Jasper, but leaving my view clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I coughed, and, so Rosalie and Emmett could keep track of what I was saying
 and warn me if I veered into indiscreet territory, summarized verbally.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

James's memories have a bit about you in them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That told us where to look.
 We were hoping that we'd find Genevieve or someone like her, and would
 be able to convince you to leave the Volturi with her help, since you wouldn't
 know she existed and Chelsea couldn't have done any snipping.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This was technically the entire story, without mentioning that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 prominently included Siobhan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice looked at me consideringly, and moved one of her longer patches of
 hair out of her face.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she confirmed finally, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

because the last time we saw any of them, they were all comatose.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stared.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We hunt separately,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 explained Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We came back and everyone in the compound was lounging on the floor, muttering.
 We checked in with the village and they were all fine, there, but those
 of the Volturi who were there were barely conscious.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

So you decided to go to Biloxi? As is the obvious and natural reaction to
 finding your coven lying around on the floor for no clear reason?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Emmett.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice frowned, and Emmett winced, probably at the failed tease that would
 have been lobbed back to him with equal wit if it had been six years earlier.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We checked in with the village, made sure they were all okay for a few days
 in case whatever-had-happened took a while to go away if ever it did, and
 then we went on vacation to Madrid, on the assumption that someone would
 call when everything was back to normal.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And then what?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Rosalie asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then, someone did call,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Addy
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I guessed suddenly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice nodded once.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She had the same general idea as you...
 only earlier, I suppose...
 and so as long as we were on vacation, we decided to come to town and look
 into my roots.
 We found Genevieve, obviously, and you heard the cover story we gave her
 so I could learn more about my sister and...
 myself.
 And just like it played out in your scenario, when a call from Volterra
 did come, we didn't answer it.
 I suppose Demetri will finish with whatever he's doing eventually and come
 find us.
 I don't know how long that will take -- he's never visible on his excursions.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She sounded ambivalent about this, like she didn't really care on net if
 Demetri ever came knocking or not.
 I glanced at Rosalie and Emmett, who looked nonplussed, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why'd Addy call you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At the time we didn't know she'd broken with the Volturi -- for all we knew
 she'd just been out of the way, like we were, when everyone in the compound
 fell over.
 So when she told me what had happened in Volterra and that I could go look
 for relatives in Biloxi, I took it as an instruction and went.
 But then Afton left a voicemail warning me not to touch her -- or failing
 that, to have Jasper touch her if she managed to take my power -- on the
 grounds that she was on the run and they didn't want her to be a precog.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Huh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Emmett.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did that earn me whatever you were leaving out of your story?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice asked me pointedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rosalie looked hard at Alice, but didn't nod or shake her head; Emmett was
 frowning stonily.
 I wasn't sure what to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then it occurred to me that my roundabout way of learning about other people
 was potentially a 
\emph on
lot
\emph default
 more useful, with a million years of memories in my head instead of five
 and a half.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

One sec,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and closed my eyes and started looking for good guesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possibility: Alice and Jasper were really still working for the Volturi.
 Someone else -- one of many candidates -- had happened across James's memories
 and determined their relevance.
 Alice and Jasper were plants, waiting for me and whoever I was working
 with to show up, as part of the plan Santiago had mentioned where small
 groups from Carlisle's rebellion would be drawn out and picked off in manageabl
e clumps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possibility: Alice and Jasper were working directly for Addy in some elaborate
 scheme, which I would have to be Siobhan to figure out because Addy still
 probably had Siobhan's power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possibility: Alice and Jasper were exactly as they appeared -- they'd wandered
 off while Chelsea was asleep at the wheel, and weren't strongly inclined
 to go anywhere in particular except for the part where Alice was interested
 in hanging out with Genevieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I cradled my face in my hands, and conjured up Magic and Memory, and said
 to them, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hop to.

 says Pera, appearing.
 I've been looking for her for a while now, but she's hard to find.
 I never expected to 
\emph default
need
\emph on
 to find her again.
 But no, of course I had to go back and hunt for her, there's no way I could
 get away with not digging up and dragging home every one of the most powerful
 witches I've ever met who're still alive.
 Caius is very curious about how Pera will react to turning.
 Frankly, so am I.
 Her power was one of the more extensible, and I think I was helpful to
 her.
 She was much more flexible afterwards than before.
 Once I've seen her, I draw on the chewy saccharine taste of Chelsea's witchcraf
t and snip away all of her connections, save the one twist of plastic wrap
 linking her to me.
 I'll be 
\emph default
relatively

 to run off at all -- ideally she'll have no one to run to.

 I said to Magic, while everyone watched me to see if I was done thinking,

would it make sense to use that story as an analogy to what Alice and Jasper

 murmured Memory,

someone participating in an intricate scheme at the behest of a third player
 on the gameboard rather than either of the obvious two...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I watched a memory from early in the Romanians' rule of the vampire world,
 where they'd been fighting another coven for dominance and assumed that
 a certain vampire was allied with them.
 When she'd proven that this wasn't the case, they'd trusted her, only to
 come perilously close to defeat when it turned out that she was a spy for
 an unrelated coalition taking advantage of the instability in the area.
 Magic rejected this analogy, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My own memory of when I and my father had caught up to Alice after the jailbreak
 out of Volterra served as a proxy for the third: historical allies, out
 of familiar contexts and without most of their original ties, but with

 Even a parallel possibility of partial verification existed -- my father
 had been able to read Alice's mind, and Alice was able to tell when I told
 the truth.

After getting the go-ahead from Siobhan to send summaries of everything
 to Alice and Jasper, I was attentive, but mostly not a participant, in
 the ensuing multi-way conversation.
 Maggie got on the phone when Siobhan wanted her to verify Alice and Jasper's
 claims more directly.
 They, and the four vampires with me, and various other people from Denali,
 all formed an enormous conference call with as many as a dozen of them
 talking in parallel at any given time.
 It was more than I could do to keep up with most of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan made a point of telling me that, no, it was not a waste of time
 for me to have done my version of a check on Alice and Jasper's loyalties
 when I could have called Maggie: the mere fact that Maggie was involved
 was significant information, and with Dwi in Volterra, spy-versions of
 Alice and Jasper could have instantly and undetectably relayed that information.

Siobhan was nearly as stumped as I about Addy's motives, though.

I'm not clear on what she wants,

I doubt highly that she's working for the Volturi.
 But she must know that they're on borrowed time without her help, until
 Marcus finds out about Didyme.

 She then went on an extended rant about how much easier everything would
 be if Marcus used e-mail, owned a phone, or otherwise were at all possible
 to get hold of from a distance.

Siobhan,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Alice dryly,

I can still share visions.
 You remember that I accidentally made Jasper think he was hallucinating
 by trying to communicate to him that I was alive, a few years ago.

Everyone went quiet for a moment at that, and then Siobhan said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Right, I'm going to write the words `Aro killed Didyme' in large letters
 on a piece of paper over here.
 This piece of paper will definitely continue to exist well into the future,
 so you should be able to send a vision of it to Marcus, have I got that
 right?

I had a lot of Alice's memories, so I thought I would be pretty well able
 to handle and sort out the visions she threw at me.

 I wasn't fooled like Jasper had been by the sight-without-eyes.
 I was able to deal with the still slides shuffling past at high speeds
 like a flipbook for a long sequence of events, or scrolled sideways between
 possibilities.
 I knew to expect the dizzy blurring in uncertain spots, the wild shifting
 of vantage point, the unmoored sensation of having no sure idea when something
 was to happen unless the picture contained an accurate clock.
 I could draw on long years of practice piecing together disparate, incomplete,
 out-of-order pictures into coherent narratives.
 I'd acquired her ability to read lips.

Marcus was standing, as he always stood when he had nothing else to do,
 in the dark in his private room in the Volturi compound -- staring, I knew,
 at the torn ribbon twisting in absent wind.
 Then there was a picture of him with his hands plastered to the sides of
 his head as though he might crush it between his palms, mouth open in shock
 or an inaudible scream -- later (?) his eyes unfocused, his arm propping
 him up against the wall as though his legs had lost the power to hold him,
 maybe reviewing the memory that Alice's shared vision had prompted -- sideways,
 he burst out of his room in a single explosion of motion, forward one image
 and he was in the throne room, forward another and he was hurling himself
 at Aro, forward another and he was halfway across the room, turned aside
 by Renata
