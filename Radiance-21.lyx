Silly puppy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I tell it, but it still doesn't know not to be scared of my mama, so I
 put its leash on a tree so it will stay there while I go and see Mama.
 Yes, there she is, through the trees! She has almost no hair now.
 That's silly.
 But she's still my mama, and she picks me up when I run over to her.
 She's been gone a long time.
 I better show her all the stuff she missed

 The threat trailed off, and Gianna's voice resumed its pleasant coo.

Okay, darling.

Molly was cute as a button, wearing a blue nightgown patterened with sheep
 and little bunny slippers.
 She took strongly after what I remembered human Gianna looking like --
 similar green eyes, but the hair and the skin each were a shade lighter.
 She leaned easily against Gianna's shoulder, looking at the visitors in
 her house with innocent curiosity.

 Addy was smiling peaceably, hands dangling at her sides nonthreateningly,
 but neither mother relaxed much.

 squealed Molly when she spotted her uncle.
 Jake laughed quietly at the portmanteau.

\begin_layout Standard

And that's Jacob, and this...

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Maggie stiffly, pointing them out for Molly.

Jacob and Adalady,

 repeated Molly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You can call me Addy,

 invited Addy, and Molly pronounced that much more readily; Gianna frowned,

Sugar toast!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Molly, pointing at Ilario, when the introductions were finished.
 He gently ruffled her hair and retrieved a slice of bread from the cupboard
 to turn into toast.
 Meanwhile, the conversation resumed at a speed and pitch inaccessible to
 Molly; I held Jake's hand and translated in silence when I realized his
 hearing was only a little better than a human's in two-legged form.

We don't keep in very regular contact with Siobhan and Liam,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Maggie explained, peeling a banana for Molly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Especially since Molly came along.
 They...
 we really don't think they'd hurt her, but there's just no such thing as
 
\shape italic

\shape default
, not with Molly on the line, and even I have to get out of the house if
 she needs a band-aid put on because of my history.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So you can't get hold of them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Addy, frowning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We have a general idea of where they are most of the time, and they have
 our address, and they do 
\shape italic
own
\shape default
 telephones but usually don't have them turned on.
 We see them about twice a year and tip them off if we think there are other
 vampires on the island.
 Since,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, with a pointed look at Addy timed for when Molly was turned away,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it is their territory.
 I mean, there is that one fellow who lives the Isle of Man who we think
 sometimes sneaks over here to hunt but who they've never managed to catch.
 But us three are the only other vampires besides Siobhan and Liam technically
 allowed.

Are you really the only vampires in Ireland?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I inquire.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's such a massive territory.
 No coven? No competitors carving out their own sections?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I've been around much of Europe, and everywhere I've found others of what
 I must now call my own kind, I've found feuds and territory disputes and
 the creation and breakage of alliances great and small.
 The Volturi were refined and civilized, after a fashion, even in violence.
 But Siobhan's life sounds...
 genuinely peaceful, at least most of the time.
 Her borders are clear, at least, not like the dividing river that had two
 covens at each other's throats over boating prey.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

None now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan says, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unless I miss my guess badly.
 There were several others before, though never so many as in your home
 country.
 I managed to divide them up and take them down or drive them out, depending
 on how stubborn they were.
 Occasionally there are...
 visitors...
 who come here to hunt, and I do not tend to chase them over the water if
 they come in and go out expeditiously.
 Not visitors like you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she clarified.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've never met one like you before, restricting yourself to animals.
 Of all things...

That wasn't mine, it was Carlisle's again; it was getting easier to tell
 during a recollection whether I owned a memory or not, instead of the dreamlike

It's very impressive that Siobhan's been able to keep the place to such
 a small vampire population,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 remarked Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There are, what, thirty or forty vampires between England and Scotland and
 Wales? I imagine some of them swim abroad occasionally for more varied
 hunting, but it's much more densely populated by the undead.

Something like thirty or forty, yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Maggie, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

though I think England's got more than its fair share compared to, I don't
 know, Belgium.
 Actually, I'm not sure if there are any vampires in Belgium.
 There's probably at least one.

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Maggie said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ireland.
 Just us and the other two.
 Actually, that's one reason I think Siobhan 
\shape italic
may
\shape default
 be a witch, though she definitely doesn't believe it, so it'd have to be
 a subtle power -- can't be making a buzzing noise in her head like mine
 does, or anything like that.
 And she definitely 
\shape italic
is
\shape default
 good at making plans that wouldn't necessarily need magic to work.

Molly crunched her sugar toast.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mummy th- sing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked, correcting her lisp with some effort, and Maggie began crooning
 beautifully in Gaelic -- which language, I realized after a moment of dizziness
, I had all the resources necessary to understand fluently beyond the conversati
onal level I'd previously had.
 Apparently I didn't have to explicitly process the memories of language-learnin
g in order to use them; they must have been stored differently somehow,
 I decided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So all you know is that they're in or near Omagh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I whispered, trying to be inaudible to Molly like the vampires, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

and have no way to pin it down.
 How can we find them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can try their phones,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Gianna, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's just not guaranteed to reach them.
 We can try tracking by scent once in the neighborhood.
 One of us will need to stay home to look after Molly.

You should probably do that,

 Ilario said to Gianna.
 Maggie was still singing, but she nodded a little.

Of the three of us you're worst in a fight, and most likely to be able to

 Ilario said gravely.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We'll rearrange ourselves on Siobhan's say-so if she has a better idea,
 but for the time being it makes the most sense.

Carlisle, how did you meet Siobhan and Liam?

 Esme is ahead of us, futilely trying to play with a pod of dolphins that

After I left Volterra, and decided to venture to the New World,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he says, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I stopped briefly in my homeland, where I first encountered Alistair, and
 -- most likely to get rid of me after I'd overstayed my welcome -- he informed
 me of Siobhan's existence.
 It didn't take me long to find her, and she believed me when I described
 my intention to move on to America, so she didn't take much issue with
 my being in her territory.
 We kept in touch, even more frequently than I do with Alistair -- that
 being due entirely to Alistair's preference for nearly unbroken solitude,
 of course.

Very.

 people.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He settled on the catch-all term after a momentary pause, maybe to deal
 with the fact that Jake, Addy and I were three different species.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's somewhat related to the Cullens' activities, although I don't know
 how aware you are of those...

Maggie, Gianna, and Ilario each had a car, but Gianna's was tiny and Ilario's
 in the shop.
 We piled into Maggie's station wagon, with Ilario in the passenger seat

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Unclario
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 both had a lengthy farewell with Molly and Gianna.
 Maggie attempting (with mixed results) to tear herself away from Gianna
 was almost indecent to watch.
 It was full daylight by the time we got on the road, but with all the windows

I had been terrified.
 I'd wanted to 
\shape italic
beg
\shape default
 her to leave my affections intact.
 I'd wanted very badly to care about...
 It was even hard to remember who exactly I'd been so very desperate to
 love.
 Eventually I pieced together a list: my mother; my father; my grandparents,
 at least the ones I'd met; my aunts and uncles -- but maybe not Jasper;
 the Denali cousins -- although on reflection I didn't think even my pre-Chelsea
 self would still like Kate, Tanya, Eleazar, and Carmen after what they'd
 done; maybe my human friends; maybe, on some distant basis, friends of
 the family like the Irish vampires or the Amazons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could remember loving...

some
\shape default

 I had clear memories of it for my mother, Carlisle and Esme, Rosalie and

I could remember

assuming

 that I

must

strange
\shape default
 if I didn't.
 But thinking of it after Chelsea, when it would in fact 
\shape italic
not
\shape default
 be strange if I didn't love the father I barely knew, the aunt I'd scarcely
 met, the distant friends-of-friends I'd never encountered...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't sure I'd ever much cared for those people in the first place.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what had never existed, Chelsea couldn't destroy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I 
\shape italic
might
\shape default
 one day to be able to meet my mother's parents, and explain to them who
 I am, and have this all go precisely the way it would if Chelsea never
 touched my relationships.
 I never met that set of grandparents.
 Maybe Chelsea found nothing to cut, between me and them.

We know

Well, I do seem to be pulling up memories that are at least sort of relevant

There's at least a million years of stuff! Uncountable amounts of stuff!
 Why would we be getting mostly memories from people we

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We've been mostly talking about people we know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I pointed out.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

And most of the memories are from a really long time ago.
 Humans Aro ate in the year 3 aren't going to have known much that's important

My magic is upset,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

She's worried that I can't tell the whole truth if I don't have all the
 memories processed -- like I'll miss something that Clarus said back in

Was that an actual person Aro ate or did you make him up as an example?

 Maggie asked.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He was an actual person,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He had a wife and four children and one granddaughter and he was a potter
 and -- I 
\shape italic
really
\shape default
 can't think off the top of my head that there's anything about him that's
 going to be important for me to remember if I'm talking about anything
 other than Clarus himself.
 Or maybe ancient Roman pottery.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe that shouldn't be your magic's job, figuring out what the whole truth
 is?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake suggested.
 Then he made a puzzled face, like he wasn't sure if what he'd just said
 had made any sense, but it gave me an idea.
 I had two of me: maybe I needed three.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That left the question of how to make there be that many of me, but a moment's
 thought had me putting 
\shape italic
both
\shape default
 of my hands on my face at the same time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there were three.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I experienced a momentary confusion while I tried to work out which of me
 was which, but it was much shorter-lived than the puzzlement before I figured
 out Magic's role.
 The third self was there for a reason: she was supposed to handle my massive
 store of memories.
 I named her -- not very creatively -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said to her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Memory said, but she didn't just 
\shape italic
say
\shape default
 it, she pulled up one of the millions of recollections of someone I remembered
 saying the word.
 There was no shortage; she'd probably be able to talk that way for the
 next few years before repeating herself unless she wanted to use very specific
 jargon or something.
 The one she'd picked was my father's memory of one of the times my mother
 had said hello to him, before she turned.
 Her voice had been very different before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't think of anything else to say 
\shape italic
to
\shape default
 Memory.
 If I came up with clever ideas for how to use or manage the store of extra
 knowledge in my head, she'd be the person to talk to, but none came to
 mind.
 Instead I looked over at Magic.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that better?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked hopefully.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said reluctantly,

completely
\shape default
 better.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I have any more clever ideas for how to deal with the memories that will
 be better, now I have Memory to handle it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do I have any ideas besides making her exist in the first place?

\begin_layout Standard

No,

 admitted Magic.

I don't.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I put my hands down in my lap.
 Jake was looking at me quizzically.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Talking to yourself in stereo?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he quipped.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Talking to myself and my other self,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's three of me now.
 I made a new one to help with the memories.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Jake laughed.
 Addy looked intrigued.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I wonder if you could have arbitrary numbers of sub-selves,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she mused, tapping her fingertip on my ear to catch up with the new development
 in my power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't know.
 I only have so many hands,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I began, but Addy interrupted me.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I keep telling you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you shouldn't think of your power as being intrinsically based in touch.
 You have range for everything else now; why not this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because I'm always in the same place as myself?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I suggested.

 I demanded.
 I

 wished that I'd worked faster to improve my power, when I'd fallen under
 Alec's, but making new sub-agents didn't seem to have gotten

\shape default
 as I added more, so if I found myself in a situation where I needed to
 put my feet together and thereby make Elspeth #4 appear, I could probably
 do it in a hurry.
 And Addy's power -- or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

leverage
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 -- over me was gone.
 She 
\shape italic
could
\shape default
 attack me directly, I supposed, but Jake, Maggie, and Ilario were all there
 to back me up if she turned it into a fight, and I knew she didn't want
 me dead or even too alienated to work with her.
 From the look on her face when I snapped at her, she was thinking of the
 same things and had come to the same conclusion.

Jake's head lolled for a couple of seconds, but then he blinked rapidly

 cut in Jake, frowning at her.
