\begin_layout Standard
I started working with Addy up in the compound instead of in my room.
 Every day, she came and walked me up the tunnel and into some unused room,
 where we worked on some part of my power until she announced we were done
 for the day and escorted me home.
 She actually paid me for my time, as well as the seeding, so I could at
 least tell the villagers that it was my job.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I still didn't like it.
 But I was as susceptible as ever to the freedom of having no secrets, and
 -- for my safety and others' -- Addy was the only person for whom I had
 no secrets.
 (Technically my father could hear everything either of us was thinking
 too, but he wasn't in a position to do anything, and I didn't have a way
 to talk to him without being noticed, let alone a way for him to talk back.)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy and I made a habit of conversing only by sending -- for privacy and,
 she said, for practice -- while we worked.
 We started by trying to add range.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
You already have range, in a way,
\emph default
 she said conversationally, 
\emph on
insofar as your power will carry with your voice -- or hand signs or body
 language.
 What you need to do is learn to think about your witchcraft as something
 that can persist beyond you, as it already can.
 Let's start by releasing you from the dependence on your hands as the mechanism
 for sending.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had me talk to her by standing barefoot on her toes, and when that worked
 after forty minutes of trying, she had me try it by touching elbows.
 I finally got a wisp of a

 it a day.

\begin_layout Standard
Addy was actually a good teacher, and since I couldn't get away with any
 more stalling than she felt like permitting me, I made progress alarmingly
 fast.
 She wanted to let me get used to being able to use non-hand body parts
 to send before trying to work on range beyond touch, and over the next
 five days I worked mostly on sending faster and denser.
 
\emph on
There's no intrinsic reason why what you share should be in real time,
\emph default
 Addy said.
 
\emph on
Especially not when you send memories instead of things you invent on the
 spot.
 You already have the entire memory, start to finish.
 Let's start small.
 Pick a five-second block of memory -- something simple -- and see if you
 can get it across to me in four seconds.
 The entire thing, though, not a summary.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't really know how to go about trying that, but I sighed and touched
 her hand and tried to pick something out.
 I settled on five seconds I spent staring in fascination at an old grandfather
 clock in the Oregon house when I was four months old: simple, innocuous,
 and definitely the requested length.
 I sent along the memory with a little extra 
\emph on
shove
\emph default
, from the same region of my mind where I felt my now-constant itch of magic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four seconds later, it was over, and I winced.
 I didn't like getting everything so fast when my interestingness to Addy
 was dependent on there being more left to learn.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Very good,
\emph default
 Addy said, mental voice full of approval that was all the more unsettling
 for being sincere.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shaved my time down to a half-second over the next few days.
 Magic complained, when I meditated after five lessons on speed, that she
 didn't like being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pushed around
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I told her that if she wanted to tell me how to send memories quickly some
 other way, that would be fine with me, but reminded her that Addy was not
 safe to annoy, and losing an ability I was working on just because Magic
 didn't like it would probably annoy her.
 Magic didn't have anything else to say on that topic and spent the rest
 of the evening guilting me about lying to Jake.

No,

 I sighed, and clung to his arm while we walked to our regularly scheduled
 brainwashing.

You'll let me know if there's anything I can do to help you,

But I might suspect you of misusing the opportunity if you say `hey, Jake,
 it's very important that you wear a pineapple on your head and waltz around
 the room for three hours straight,' or something,

 he teased.

 I said, smiling just a little bit.

 he agreed, grinning at having successfully coaxed me into a smile.

\begin_layout Standard
Chelsea was still making a habit of standing in our pack's section.
 We were wearing a lot of brown, in keeping with the custom of matching
 the uniforms and alpha fur colors, but I didn't think she was standing
 with us because we matched her sandals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I avoided looking directly at her -- pretending that I thought, like everyone
 else, that she was just Our Friend Chelsea attending the assembly as always
 and unremarkable wherever she chose to stand.
 I let the announcements of the day wash over me as Rachel and Becky announced
 them -- Elena's first birthday and Joel's fifteenth, the awarding of a
 single room to Marilyn for heroism in her last field engagement out in
 the Philippines, a trip planned for people with topside privileges to go
 to Venice for a few days.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The warm, cozy feeling bubbled up inside me -- not Chelsea's direct handiwork,
 but a consequence.
 But it could only get so far without the freedom from secrecy I had when
 I first arrived, and I tumbled gratefully into sleep shortly after Jake
 and I went home.

The next day Addy wanted to turn me into a weapon.
 
\emph on
If you can work fast -- and you have consistently cut your time as we practice
 -- you might be able to act and react quickly enough to disorient an attacker,
 perhaps even a vampire attacker once you've practiced enough,

 she suggested.

Unfamiliar witchcraft sensations are the obvious choice.
 Your itch, and whatever else you can pile into the same sending.

Will you send me more witch memories, then?
\emph default
 I asked.
 
\emph on
I only know what the powers feel like through your own memories of copying
 them, and that's different since it all goes through your power.
 The other witches must feel things directly; they can't all taste their
 powers.

Fair enough,

I can never think of a good analogy for what relationships feel like.
 Maybe it's because they're all different.
 The ones emanating from Marcus are mostly like...
 perhaps cotton thread.
 Soft when loose, almost sharp when taut, full of little fibers fuzzing
 out but contributing to a longer twist of connection.
 Then there's the exception, glaringly obvious and impregnable no matter
 how I might hack at it, like a million threads coiled together for strength
 and then encased in diamond for good measure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Master Aro wants me to keep Marcus with us -- Marcus is essential; I can
 only grope around in the dark for relationships, not 
\emph default
see
\emph on
 them, not piece together all the details of how they work in motion.
 I can flail around and cut, I can seize loose tendrils and moor them where
 they belong and coax them into growth -- but I can't see what I'm doing,
 and in the long term, that would render me ineffective at the scale Master
 Aro has in mind for the future.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
That diamond-wrapped rope was pulling Marcus away from us, and all my work
 -- on him 
\emph default
and
\emph on
 on Didyme -- wasn't holding him, or rather them.
 He didn't love us enough to stay if it would suit her to be elsewhere.
 Master Aro and Caius weren't brothers enough to him; Athenodora and Sulpicia
 not sisters enough; I not friend enough.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Everyone must love me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
(I'm terrified that one day I will meet someone who lashes me to him with
 the same unassailable connection, and he will try to pull me away from
 Master Aro, and I will have no choice but to follow and every dream of
 glory will die so soon after our coven's creation! I'm indispensable.
 I made sure of that when I killed my cousin.
 Master Aro knows why I went back to that miserable hamlet and drank her,
 of course, and he didn't like it, but now she's dead and I'm the only cutter
 and weaver of threads in the world, and Master Aro can never be rid of
 me if he wants to achieve his ambitions.
 I'll be quite loyal to his plans as long as I'm guaranteed my place, and
 he knows that.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
But now Didyme is a memory (along with the coven who killed her, the fools
 -- someday every vampire on the earth will know that it's a death sentence
 to trespass on our interests this way).
 She cannot wonder aloud if perhaps a quieter life in the north would be
 more to her taste, and she cannot lead him away by her diamond leash, even
 though it will always be there connecting him to the dead woman he loved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Now, I can pull the drooping cotton tighter still, fasten Marcus to Master
 Aro and to Caius and to Athenodora and to Sulpicia (I was afraid, too,
 when she came along and caught Master Aro's eye so effectively, but she
 liked the picture of the queenly leisure he promised her, and will not
 entice him out of the group).
 And to me, of course.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Everyone must love me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
So I turn my hand at the end of my wrist, feeling along the invisible threads,
 and I let my fingers spread, and the string turns and grows and tightens.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Marcus looks at me with dim black eyes.
 He knows exactly what I'm doing, but I am not Didyme, and that sharply
 limits how much he can care about it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Within that limit, though, he'll love me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Everyone must love me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I work for some hours, to be quite sure that Marcus won't slip off in a
 moment of our inattention and provoke the nearest nomad into putting him
 out of his misery.
 We must be too close to him for him to let us down.
 We must be too important to him for him to despair in loneliness.
 Cotton writhes in my trembling hands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Finally, I think I've done enough for a short time; Marcus is at least tied
 enough that he can hunt alone and be expected to return to us.
 I tuck an errant strand of his hair behind his ear, and hold out my arms
 for a hug, which he provides dutifully before turning to find his dinner.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, Master?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It pleases him to be called that.
 I am the first subordinate of the Volturi, the first who isn't one of the
 brothers or their wives, and so I am the first to use the title for him.
 I don't care, particularly.
 Being in charge isn't as important as being essential.
 We could more easily lose Caius than me; I remain unsure why Master Aro
 made powerless Caius a part of the brotherhood to begin with, but there
 he is.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Most of the relationships stretching out from Master Aro feel like glass,
 spun into some improbable thin spikes or rods.
 The one that links him to Sulpicia is completely unlike glass -- it feels
 warmer and has none of the brittleness; I could try to crush it and it
 wouldn't even dent.

There is too much to do, and now that revenge has been taken on Didyme's

 As long as he's standing there, I bend my thumb to catch the glassy tendril
 of gratitude -- a bit more robust than I would have guessed, not that I
 have any way to measure precisely -- and melt it into the spine of glass
 that points in my direction, bolstering its strength.
 Just because he is my Master doesn't mean that he shouldn't love me.

Addy ended the memory there, and I fought the urge to twitch my fingers

I hate human towns.
 They're convenient places to find meals -- although even for that purpose
 I'd prefer a longer, more pleasant rural hunt.
 That's the only virtue of habitation centers.
 The places are lousy with filth and vermin, and the air is hot with the
 smell of their blood, and that would be quite enough to make the towns
 unpleasant, but that's not what makes me hate them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Human towns are full of people, and none of them love me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
It's not worth the effort to fix that, really.
 The humans are food or annoyances or useful sources of clothing, not subjects
 or friends or even stimulating conversationalists.
 I used to take over every miserable fief I passed through, spending a few
 hours to make the weak and easily sculpted humans worship me like a goddess
 for several days before I became bored and started eating them.
 I have more important tasks now -- I'm indispensable to Master Aro! --
 and it's not a good use of my time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
But it still aches, all those humans rushing from place to place and never
 sparing me a second thought.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I'm only here for the trinkets Sulpicia wanted.
 She's amused by sending me on errands; I remain the only Volturi subordinate,
 as Master Aro wants to be very selective about how he grows our coven and
 no one except me has passed muster thus far without being the mate of one
 of the brothers.
 My core task is far more important than fetching toys for her, but it does
 not take up all of my time, and besides, every task I perform for haughty
 Sulpicia lets me entwine more of her dependence on my servitude into her
 love for me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
It's a few moments past dusk, but there are enough lamps and candles burning
 that even humans can see a little, and some of them are still out and about.
 There are two boys, fighting with pathetically well-telegraphed punches
 and ineffectual kicks over something or other.
 There is really no point to humans except as food; it's almost charmingly
 futile, the way they build their disgusting towns and form their trivial
 societies.
 Humans are clumsy and weak and ugly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Well, one of those boys isn't ugly, really.
 And there's something about how he fights.
 His opponent is tough, and holding his own, but there's some -- 
\emph default
weight
\emph on
 to the handsome boy's blows that doesn't seem normal.
 Some lightness to his body when he dodges.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I stand in the shadows and watch the better-looking boy -- he's probably
 nearing twenty, not quite a boy anymore, even though anyone who hasn't
 gone gray seems that way to me at my two centuries of age -- skillfully
 pummel the ugly one until he yields.
 There is definitely an uncanniness to the way the comely one moves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I follow him as he leaves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
He's headed home, apparently.
 He jogs -- again the unusual momentum, more than a human should be able
 to put behind a stride! -- through the towns, and I follow at a brisk walk.
 He's interesting.
 Perhaps the oddness in his motions is an extra ability, manifesting early
 as my gift did.
 Perhaps that will mean Master Aro will let him join us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I want him.

He arrives at home.
 It's a large family; the object of my interest has one living parent, to
 judge by their chatter, and six siblings, all younger than him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
He loves them and not me; I can tell, crouching outside his house in the
 dark and clenching my fists to feel the relationships coiling out from
 him like strips of leather.
 Perhaps if I take them away he will leave his house again, and then I can
 catch him and make him love me.
 I need him to love me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Cut and cut and cut, and he's untethered.
 I hear the cheer in his voice falter; the leathery lines try to spawn themselve
s back, thin shadows of the originals but still not acceptable.
 Cut, cut, cut.
 Come out, come out, come out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Eventually he does.
 I hear the excuse -- he has a charming, rough voice.
 They let him go without protest, suspecting nothing.
 He walks back towards the center of town, and I push my hood down and step
 into his path.
 I'm beautiful -- part of the package -- and there's enough moonlight for
 him to see it.
 He stops.

 I touch him, for the first time, my fingers threading through his messy

It's hard enough to force his last sister's blood down my throat that I'm
 confident I'll be able to leave him alive.
 I swallow as much as I possibly can, wipe a drop off my chin, and fly at
 top speed back to the spot where I left my Afton.
 A sweep of my little finger takes care of the last feelings for the dead
 family up the road; I shouldn't like him to be distressed.
 I reach out and pull him towards me.

I didn't manage that trick that day.
 Addy didn't seem particularly discouraged, and brought me home to Jake

 Jake hugged me and patted my hair; it had grown down my back since I'd
