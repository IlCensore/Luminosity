 I turned back to Didyme and resumed speaking Greek.

What about him?

You do mean Marcus of the Volturi, and not some other Marcus?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she clarified, sounding very earnest about it.

Yes...

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can you tell me how to find him?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked urgently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know where I am or how I came to be turned human, but I've been...
 here, wherever this is...
 for more than a week now, and I don't know the language, and I need to
 find my husband.
 And my brother,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added as an afterthought.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was with my brother when whatever happened, happened.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Didyme had never realized who killed her.
 She'd thought they'd been ambushed, and at least until the moment Aro set
 her aflame, she had never suspected her brother...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had no idea what the correct order to disclose information to this woman
 was.
 I didn't even know

\emph default
 she needed to be updated on Didyme's details.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said John, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't understand you like that.
 Any chance we've all got some language in common?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You never learned Early Latin, and that's the only other language she picked
 up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wait, how do you know that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you a witch? With the power to speak any language, or something?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's complicated.
 I'm a witch but not that kind.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did she use to be a vampire too?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked, gesturing at Didyme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's like you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I hedged, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but she spent less than a year as a vampire so language learning wasn't
 her top priority.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I could have projected translations to either or both of them, but I didn't
 want to risk scrambling their brains with more applications of my power
 beyond what had already happened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you know where Marcus is?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Didyme asked again.
 She'd been killed before the coven set up permanent shop in Volterra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, pinned down by the direct question, and she lit up.
 I didn't feel like I remembered it felt to be within her aura of happiness,
 but like her brother, Didyme hadn't developed her witchcraft until after
 turning.
 It seemed like the power hadn't accompanied the memories.
 She still had a cheering presence, but it couldn't dissolve the awkwardness
 of the situation.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know where he is, but I can't just take you out of here like that.
 This is 
\emph on
super complicated
\emph default
.
 Wait a minute while I talk to that guy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I would have said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doctor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but psychiatry wasn't easy to discuss in either dead language; I turned
 to John and told him to wait too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Switching back to Italian, I asked Dr.
 Valenti, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are their names?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Those two are Benito Bianchi and Paola Greco,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What languages are they speaking? How could they have learned them? They
 were both monolingual Italian natives until July 4.
 You said you've seen this kind of thing before? Is that how you learned
 to talk to them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's speaking Old English and she's speaking Ancient Greek,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My experience with this sort of thing is definitely related to why I know
 the languages.
 I've seen similar, but not identical, presentation.
 I'll need to consult with some of my colleagues.
 I might want to arrange for the patients to be moved to another facility,
 where they can get specialist treatment.
 Were they all identified? Are their families accessible?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It was weird speaking as though I had authority to a guy who was probably
 at least six or seven times my age and had an advanced degree, but I didn't
 think I'd get anywhere by talking meekly, and unlike most of the people
 I interacted with on a regular basis he wasn't my physical superior.
 (Also unlike most of the people I interacted with on a regular basis, he
 probably wasn't accustomed to considering violence a first or second resort
 to solving differences of opinion, which made the physical superiority
 thing less relevant.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, we know who they all are,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Dr.
 Valenti said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want their files?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I could just look them over briefly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that would be perfect.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're thinking some kind of environmental cause,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he told me, leading me out to where they kept their documents, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

because they were all near the same area at the time.
 Two of the less aware patients are brothers...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He went on about the circumstances under which all of the blast victims
 had been discovered, and I paid the minimum amount of attention to be able
 to replay the information for everyone else later; I paged through the
 files with similar intent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd known from what Addy had said about the blast victims that the ones
 left alive were only left that way because they were under too much scrutiny
 to be done away with by the time the Volturi were in a position to deal
 with the problem.
 Dr.
 Valenti gave no indication that he even knew about the other nine, and
 none of the files I read mentioned them.
 They would, I supposed, have fallen insensate into some location where
 they were unlikely to be noticed; or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recognized themselves
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 promptly and wandered off lucidly enough not to be picked up; or crashed
 their cars and been assumed to have head trauma instead of an inexplicable
 psychological disorder.
 At any rate, the six that were there were the six left alive, so I scanned
 their files and discussed them with Dr.
 Valenti.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paola was twenty years old -- two years older than Didyme had been when
 Aro thought she was old enough to turn -- and she had living parents, two
 brothers, and a handful of nieces and nephews, but she wasn't married and
 had no kids.
 Benito, thirty-six, was divorced with a young son, and he had a sister
 and his father was alive.
 I tried, and failed, to think of a good way to handle those families, and
 the others, if it turned out that the original people were unrecoverable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
John/Benito and Didyme/Paola waited impatiently, but calmly, while I did
 all of this, the significance of the files and the modern Italian completely
 wasted on minds more than a thousand years out of their times.
 I was actually somewhat impressed with them for not being completely terrified
 or bowled over by things like Dr.
 Valenti's digital watch, or the computer that they could just see from
 the dayroom, or the linoleum.
 I didn't know whether to interpret it as leftover from Benito and Paola's
 comfort with the twenty-first century, or leftover from John and Didyme's
 vampiric confidence that anything not actively on fire wouldn't hurt them
 much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You've been giving them all this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, pointing at a list of medications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Trying, anyway.
 Benito and Paola don't cooperate with the regimen.
 Benito actually bit an orderly, and drew blood,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Dr.
 Valenti.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Normally we don't need to restrain them; it's only when we administer the
 drugs that they've ever become violent.
 You see we're keeping the dosages low

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because you don't actually know what's wrong with them, and know you're
 guessing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, allowing my tone to become slightly clipped.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I must recommend as strongly as possible that the medications be discontinued
 as quickly as is safe, assuming they remain at this facility for any length
 of time.
 It's not going to help; they'll only get side effects.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

Benito and Paola did respond to

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Benito and Paola's improved condition relative to the other four patients
 is unrelated to the drug regimen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I interrupted confidently.
 (The other four did bear assorted degrees of resemblance to people whose
 memories I had stored in my head, but it was perhaps not close enough,
 or they hadn't looked in a mirror, or there was something about John and
 Didyme in particular that had allowed their memories to surface where others
 hadn't.) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At any rate, every person I've seen with this disorder has made a complete
 recovery without any pharmaceutical intervention at all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, only slightly dubious under the force of my honesty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked at the wall clock; I'd been gone from the compound for nearly half
 an hour and it was time to check in with my mother.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need to contact my colleagues,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Excuse me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of...
 course,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Dr.
 Valenti.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking a guess that nobody in the hospital would know what I was saying,
 I greeted my mother in Norwegian when she answered the phone.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi, Mama,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, speaking rapidly enough that I'd be tricky to understand even if
 someone who knew the language 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 in earshot.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Four of the blast victims are comatose -- babbling about all sorts of things
 from all sorts of people.
 Two of them, though, got a look in the mirror, `recognized themselves'
 as being dead vampires who looked similar, and are basically acting like
 they were magically turned into humans and time-traveled.
 I think the best thing to do would be to get Addy in here wearing Aro's
 power, while she can, and have her check them out and see what's going
 on.
 But the really crazy thing is who the patient named Paola thinks she is...
 Um, who's in the room with you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I would be able to whisper quietly enough that my voice shouldn't carry
 any farther than that, but it would be too big a hint to ask directly if
 Marcus was there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A lot of disassembled Volturi -- we're keeping Renata, by the way, she doesn't
 seem too upset about the regime change except for the new dietary requirements
 -- and Alec, our 
\emph on
friend
\emph default
 the Imperial Factotum, and your daddy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because Paola thinks she's Didyme,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a silence.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh my,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's about what I was thinking,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I finished conveying the details of the situation to my mother, and she
 arranged for Addy to come bearing Aro's power just after sunset.
 Since Paola-or-Didyme wasn't currently a witch, Addy's copying wouldn't
 interfere with the read, and Addy would be able to figure out what was
 there in her head.
 Likewise with Benito-or-John.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there was any Paola left, we'd see about getting her to surface, if that
 was possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there wasn't...
 if Paola was somehow gone altogether and there was only Didyme...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I wasn't sure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First things first.
 My mother got Carlisle's help in creating an identity for our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

specialist facility
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in case we wound up needing or wanting to move the blast victims.
 I was instructed to describe Paola and Benito as having 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mnemic displacement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the other four as having 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mnemic overload
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which were accurate enough terms (given what we knew) that I expected
 to be able to deliver them without a blip in my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

honesty voice".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I told Dr.
 Valenti that my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

colleague
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Addy) would be on her way shortly to make a more detailed examination
 of the six patients, and assured him that she was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at least my equal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the field of mnemic disorders.
 It wasn't lost on me that Addy was responsible for the patients' condition
 in the first place.
 Still, she hadn't gone out of her way to hurt them; it had been an accident,
 albeit a predictable one.
 She probably didn't really care about what she'd done but she didn't have
 any reason to do worse, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy showed up at the hospital shortly after sunset.
 She was dressed up a little more formally than was usual for her, although
 she hadn't turned up in a labcoat or anything like it, and she introduced
 herself cordially to Dr.
 Valenti and went to where the six patients were.
 Under the guise of peering into their eyes like she was checking for dilated
 pupils, she touched the chins of each of the six while I discreetly showed
 her the files I'd read.
 John and Didyme (or Benito and Paola -- I couldn't decide how to think
 of them, I kept attaching both names to each one) knew immediately that
 Addy was a vampire, although I had to explain to them why her eyes were
 gold.
 (John was disgusted, Didyme vaguely curious.) Addy herself didn't talk directly
 to them; she was busy mulling over the memories she'd picked up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked her in Norwegian, to prevent inopportune eavesdropping from the
 staff or awkward listening in from either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mnemic displacement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sufferer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The four folks we're saying have mnemic overload are weirder to read than
 anyone else Aro or I ever pulled memory from before,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're full of fragments from everybody in the payload -- me, you, Aro,
 your father, everyone -- but it's 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 wispy and hard to get at, like a vampire's human memories are after the
 vampire turns.
 The human memories like from, say, Gianna, dramatically more so than yours
 or the vampire memories.
 As far as I can tell, everything I put in the blast is there, but not 
\emph on
attached
\emph default
 to what it should be.
 For instance, they know, or their heads contain information about, where
 I was on the fourth of July in 1857, and where I was on the fifth of July
 in 1857, but those things don't flow together in sequence.
 They'd have to connect them up manually, so to speak, and they don't have
 enough of a train of thought to manage anything of the kind.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And the mnemic displacement cases?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Contain less,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just the memories from John and Didyme respectively.
 Mostly the vampire ones, and to a sharply lesser extent, the human ones.
 They're losing bits of the vampire ones too as time wears on, though.
 For instance, Paola couldn't tell you how many windows were in the room
 where Didyme woke up when she finished turning.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Didyme -- Paola -- the female mnemic displacement case was evincing interest
 in our conversation, hearing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

her
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 name, but Addy ignored her and I didn't pause to translate.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Whereas you and I, with brains designed to hold arbitrary amounts of information
, have no trouble holding on to that data.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about Paola, or Benito?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are...
 they 
\emph on
there
\emph default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The one thing that's 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 there, in any of the six, is the memories 
\emph on
these
\emph default
 humans used to have.
 Those are 
\emph on
gone
\emph default
.
 I couldn't have told you their names were Paola and Benito and so on if
 you hadn't sent me what you remember of the files, let alone anything else
 about them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Completely gone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked faintly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unless something about the mnemic disorder, if that's what we're calling
 it, interacts strangely with Aro's power and I just can't read those memories?
 Yes.
 Completely gone.
 Not hidden, not repressed, not temporarily forgotten, not of lesser importance,
 
\emph on
absent
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Um,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

For all practical purposes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

sitting over there are Didyme and John, vampires from centuries ago who
 have been turned into humans and may have some genetic differences beyond
 that.
 And four irretrievable nutcases who might be salvageable if we get them
 to look into reflective surfaces, although they all look at least as much
 like 
\emph on

 as the displacement pair look like who they think they are, so I'm not
 sure how they've managed to avoid `displacing' for this long.
 There are mirrors in this room.

That would explain why Benito would look in the mirror and think he was

Tends to even out the distinctive features.
 Anyway.
 So we've got Didyme and John and four people who don't look much like any
 young vampires.
 Near as I can tell, there's no way to get anything else out of this situation.
 The question is how Marcus will react.
 And, I suppose, whether we turn John, and what we tell the biological families.

Presumably.
 And I doubt she'll object.
 Look at her, shiny-eyed waiting for us to take her to her mate, insofar
 as he can retain that distinction to a human-brained person.
 Her family might complain, of course, and the strategy `kill them if they
 become inconvenient' is probably off the table with our favorite Empress

He has

See if that knocks everything loose? Turn them and hope their new, improved

The other language has a number of specialized technical expressions we

John was executed for creating an immortal child, Anne.
 Most immortal children were killed with their creators but not her.

 She lived with the Volturi until 1754, and then Aro gave up on the project
 and murdered her and the others.

In 2005, a witch joined the Volturi who had the power to copy other witches'
 powers by touching them.
 She copied Aro, and read all of the memories he had ever absorbed, including
 John's up until shortly before his death in 1007.
 Thirteen days ago, she borrowed 
\emph on
my

 power, which is complicated but includes the ability to 
\emph on

 And she sent them

 and me and most of the Volturi.

The vampires and me -- I'm a half-vampire, don't ask, it's a story for later

 The humans that the blast hit weren't equipped to handle so much information,
 though.
 Their original memories were erased completely.
 But...
 Benito looks a lot like John did.
 Enough that when Benito saw his reflection after being hit with all of
 the memories, he

 John, and all of the memories except John's faded.

She was...

 There was a two-year period in the fourteenth century where they tried
 having Jane administer punishments to misbehaving children as a means of
 controlling their tantrums and other unwanted tendencies, but that was
 eventually discontinued, mostly because Jane didn't have a sufficiently

You could potentially live Benito's life.
 We don't have a way to get his memories, but the copying witch has a piece
 of Aro leftover that she could use to read Benito's family and friends,
 and then I could tell you what you would need to know to fill the role
 passably.
 We can probably get you out of this hospital even without doing that, although
 it might be tricky, and then...
 well, if you want to be a vampire, you'll have to take it up with the Empress
 Regnant.
 If you don't, she'd probably consider setting you up wherever with enough
 money to get started doing whatever as reparations or something.

\begin_layout Standard
I had to start with a brief aside about how we'd started numbering years
 since Didyme's time, which in combination with the present number in use
 stunned her enough that she remained completely silent through the rest

 and tricked Marcus into working for him anyway for the next couple thousand
 years.
 Even when I told her that her brother was dead at her husband's hands as
 part of a revolution against a government that she'd never seen take power.
 Even when I explained that Marcus was just shy of a mile away, but didn't
 know she was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, and if he saw her, might or might not find her to be Didyme according
 to the capricious magic of the mate bond.
 Even when I made it clear that the knees she was looking at when she fixed
 her gaze downward had belonged to someone named Paola Greco.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I was done with my explanation, she looked up from her knees to me
 and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am sorry about Paola.
 But I want to be Didyme.
 If Marcus looks at me and says I'm not his wife...
 then I suppose I can't be.
 Then perhaps I'll be Paola instead if you and the other witch can do that,
 to help her family.
 But if I can, I want to be Didyme.
 Marcus has already spent far longer with his loss than Paola's relatives
 have.
