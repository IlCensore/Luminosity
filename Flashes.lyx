\begin_layout Chapter
Sulpicia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly, so slowly that she almost did not notice it, Sulpicia began to hate
 the sound of her own voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a pretty voice.
 It was prettier than it needed to be to order servants to and fro, prettier
 than it needed to be to entreat her husband, prettier than it needed to
 be to instruct her children and stepchildren.
 And when she ordered or entreated or instructed, she was obeyed and catered
 to and attended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sulpicia could hardly forget that she was living a charmed life -- her mother
 told her, every time the two saw each other.
 So lucky! So blessed! So fortunate! to have moved up so far in the world,
 to be seventeen and beautiful and married to a rich widower with only daughters
 and to have given him two sons as easy as breathing (
\emph on
ha
\emph default
, Sulpicia thought, when her mother first told her how 
\emph on
easy
\emph default
 her childbearing had been; there was no greater pain possible in the world,
 even if she'd gotten through the process with somewhat more alacrity than
 most).
 So lucky, so blessed, so fortunate, to have that husband's favor and love
 such that all she had to do was ask, and anything was hers
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But she still had to 
\emph on
ask
\emph default
.
 She still had to draw breath (infinitely easier than giving birth, whatever
 her mother said, but still a step in the process) and 
\emph on
ask
\emph default
.
 This was expected with servants, slow and stupid creatures; it was unremarkable
 with children, foolish and with no capacity to focus on others' patterns
 and habits.
 But her husband ought to have done better.
 Yet, however much esteem she'd bought with her two sons, her husband did
 not 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 her.
 He did not anticipate her needs, and she doubted he'd notice if she made
 a request completely out of character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She tried it, one day -- told him she wanted a pair of sandals so completely
 repulsive that she had not correctly identified them 
\emph on
as sandals
\emph default
 at first glance -- and the next thing she knew, they were hers.
 No remark that they were unlike her customary footwear, that they were
 ugly and she was too beautiful to wear such unflattering things, that they
 were not fashionable and she was normally quite attentive to the current
 style.
 Just the sandals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If she had to ask for everything, how could she get anything that she did
 not know 
\emph on
how
\emph default
 to ask for?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sulpicia gave up testing her husband.
 He was hopeless, obviously.
 She made sharper and ruder demands of him, was shorter with the children,
 outright screamed at the servants.
 And she came to hate her voice, so miserably necessary, so inadequate.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aro was not, exactly, hunting.
 Or -- not for food.
 He was looking, if idly, for specially gifted persons, for while he hadn't
 come into his own gift until turned, Marcus had known inklings of his beforehan
d and Chelsea had always had the full breadth of hers.
 Aro and Caius and Marcus -- and Athenodora, when she bothered to participate
 in their council, though she was more often whiling away her time staring
 into space, thinking abstract thoughts, and tolerating Chelsea's prattle
 -- agreed: that supernatural gifts were key to realizing their ambitions.
 It would be untenable to match the Romanians' army in numbers.
 Overpowering them with magic was more likely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trouble was that the gifted were so 
\emph on
rare
\emph default
.
 Marcus was an extraordinary find, Aro himself still more so.
 Chelsea magnificent.
 But they were not precisely suited to destroying enemies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aro still hoped that his young sister would prove to be gifted like him
 after her own change, but she was only sixteen yet, and he was wary of
 altering her so young.
 (The age gap was immense, but they 
\emph on
were
\emph default
 full siblings regardless of the cruel rumors about his father's failure
 to get his wife with child for twenty-three years after the firstborn:
 Aro had 
\emph on
checked
\emph default
 when it first crossed his mind to change his sister, with one cold finger
 brushed across his mother's cheekbone in the night, and while she was not
 a woman of perfect fidelity, the timing was not correct for Didyme to be
 the result of her indiscretion.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, Didyme was still too young, although he would consider stealing
 her away sooner if she wound up betrothed.
 If he ever found out what happened to a bitten pregnant woman he would
 prefer that his sister not be the informant.
 She would have been married already, but their parents were dithering,
 holding out for better offers, because Didyme was quite lovely and sweet
 of disposition and ought to 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 better offers.
 In fact, only the dark gossip speculating on Aro's own unexplained disappearanc
e fourteen years gone cast enough suspicion on the family's reputation to
 diminish the quality of her proposals.
 It suited Aro's purposes for it to be so, or he might have intervened somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spied on Didyme, once monthly, to be sure that she was in good health
 and not undergoing some emergency of constitution that would call for her
 prompt transformation.
 If he had to change her at sixteen (or bring her to Caius for the purpose,
 should he not trust his own control) he would.
 But, eighteen would be better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was not due to steal into Didyme's home -- what once was his home too,
 fourteen years gone, though he barely remembered living there -- and confirm
 that promising Didyme was not feverish or chilled or otherwise unwell for
 another week.
 And this allowed the coven to range away from Greece where she lived.
 Such exploration was how they had found Chelsea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such exploration was what put him in Rome when he found Sulpicia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was caught by the sun.
 Fickle clouds.
 He'd expected them to last longer, expected to be able to wade through
 crowds seeking telltale talented life-histories.
 And whatever the Romanians thought, it was in Aro's opinion a laughably
 dreadful idea to advertise oneself to the mortals.
 The red eyes might be written off as an odd malady, or overlooked entirely
 if he squinted and concealed his irises with shadows.
 The glittering skin in the daylight...
 unlikely to meet similar aplomb.
 More likely to prompt annoying attempts on his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when the sun burst forth, the clouds swept away in a swift breath of
 wind, Aro ducked into the shade of a house to wait for the return of the
 cloud cover, or nightfall.
 (He mused that some kind of concealing cloak -- with gloves and a hood
 -- would be useful to have in situations like this.
 He would look into getting one, later.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lady of said house peered out the window at him, but he didn't look
 her way, preferring to lose himself in thought for as long as he needed
 to await the pleasure of the weather.

 she said again, and reached out the window to tap him on the shoulder,
 as though he could have failed to 
\emph on
hear
\emph default
 her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her littlest finger brushed momentarily over the edge of his collar, and
 quite involuntarily, he pulled her memories into himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Human memories were easier than vampire ones to disentangle and comprehend.
 Before she had drawn her hand back to the windowsill, he knew her name,
 her family situation, her frustrated unclear desires, her favorite color
 and her hatred of her voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And before he even turned around to look at her face, he knew she was 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would have taken him longer to figure it out if he hadn't been with Caius
 and Athenodora both just that morning.
 Usually he spoke to Caius alone; he'd read his

 mate, was acquainted with her, but rarely sought her companionship unless
 she came as part of a matched set with her husband.
 Still, the pair of them, Caius capturing the rapt attention of customarily
 fanciful Athenodora as she brought a smile to his otherwise dour face,
 were fresh in Aro's mind, and he recognized the 
\emph on
insistence
\emph default
 in his thoughts arcing over to Sulpicia as the same demand for companionship
 his covenmates shared.
 The same overarching instinctual keen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could lift her out of the house via the window, carry her off -- who
 cared if anyone saw him? Stefan and Vladimir, lax and lazy overseers hundreds
 of miles distant, certainly didn't, and any 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 indiscretion would probably not bring torchlit mobs cresting over the hills
 -- he could turn her, all without so much as a by-your-leave

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet...
 hm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at her, smiled rakishly.
 She stepped back and tucked the chilled finger that had touched him into
 her other hand, slightly openmouthed at the granite smoothness of his features,
 the darkened red eyes that might look brown without good light.

 she asked.
 This was the question she'd had in mind from the beginning -- who was this
 strange man lurking in the shadow of her house? -- but the tone came out
 differently than she'd meant, curiosity rather than suspicion.

\end_inset

Shhhh,

 he said, smirking, placing a finger over her lips.

\begin_layout Standard
Why inflict it on her?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was more than an hour before the sun retreated behind the clouds.
 The servants had the children, her husband was off somewhere doing something
 Sulpicia didn't know or care about, and she stood at her window and listened
 to the strange man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She didn't need to talk.
 After a minute, she didn't want to, forgetting to be affronted at his attempt
 to silence her.
 He touched her presumptuously, constantly, adjusting her hair and brushing
 her cheeks and cataloguing all the ways their fingers could interlace,
 and she was entranced enough that she did not back away.
 His hands were cool, but they warmed up over time as he spoke in low, insinuati
ng tones that made her spine tingle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He told her, at the beckoning of her thoughts, his name, where he was from,
 what he was doing in Rome, and, when she began to wonder, what he was,
 what he could do.
 There was no point and no fairness in holding back from her (and he shouldn't
 like to oblige her to speak out loud, to insist on pressing a question,
 if she wanted some answer he could provide).
 She would know everything eventually.
 If, unthinkably, he bungled the elaborate seduction he had in mind, all
 would be made right by her change; he could be a little reckless if he
 wanted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was emboldened further still by her intense, albeit non-supernatural,
 attraction, simmering obviously through the hundreds of little touches
 he bestowed on her to update his record of her mind.
 He almost laughed at her when she wondered, a fleeting wild thought, if
 her husband would say 
\emph on

 should she trouble to formulate the request for permission to take this
 man as a lover

Aro pressed a chilly kiss to the inside of her wrist, so gentle it was almost
 not there, and Sulpicia shivered.
 She could probably put her husband off for a day, two perhaps, claim to

 Aro said reasonably.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He was lying.
 He wouldn't permit her to stay if she wanted to with all her heart, let
 alone with this halfhearted misgiving.
 She, however, could not read his mind.
 Let her think she had the option; let her refuse it of her own volition.

Her husband

 Aro said in a voice like silk and wine, and, under the new clouds, before

 away from her and slipped off into the city.

Sulpicia took a minute to compose herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She sat, and stood, and walked from one room to the next, and poured herself
 a glass of wine the color of Aro's eyes, and sat again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She went to where the servants were keeping her sons, and the younger one,
 just a baby, chose that moment to scream and scream and 
\emph on
scream
\emph default
, and the older one pulled her hair and tugged at her clothes when she tried
 to pick him up.
 Her stepdaughters pestered her for attention when she went near them.
 If she ignored them they'd whine to their father later and he'd sigh and
 tell Sulpicia that it would be lovely if she'd take some time to get to
 know the girls.
 If she gave them the attention they demanded, sooner or later it would
 take a turn to resentment over the fact that she wasn't their mother and
 they would shriek at her with shrill accusations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sulpicia stared at her crying baby, longing to claw out her ears.
 She handed the toddler off to the nurse, and left the room again.
 She poured herself more wine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her husband was home early from...
 whatever it was he did all day.
 Sulpicia hadn't ever cared and saw no reason to start.
 She pretended illness, lounging and coughing until her throat really did
 feel raw.
 Aro wanted her to have nothing to do with her husband, and perhaps she
 would oblige him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her husband did not oblige her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was not violent, not dramatic, not even particularly 
\emph on
unusual
\emph default
 in anything but her uncommon level of disinterest.
 She didn't try to fight him off of her once she realized her ruse wasn't
 having the desired effect.
 Her mother's lectures about wifely duties replayed themselves in her head
 and she waited for it to be over with the same boredom of waiting for her
 baby to stop crying or her life to stop dissatisfying her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would Aro be cross with her? she asked herself, only after the fact.
 Would he refuse to take her away with him because she'd failed? It didn't
 occur to her to question whether that had been his original intention.
 If she were any judge of sincerity, it had, though why 
\emph on
she
\emph default
 had caught his eye she was unsure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She noted that the prospect of Aro's abandonment -- even though she'd only
 spent a little over an hour in his company -- was rather frightening, and
 hugged herself and shivered and hated the thought of listening to that
 baby scream for one hour longer.
 Of staying with a husband who could

Sulpicia cried exactly three tears, then wiped them away and waited by the

\begin_layout Standard
She knew one moment of doubt about whether Aro would come back at all, but
 then returned to worrying that he 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 come, and would touch her just the one more time it would take to know
 that she hadn't done what he'd asked, and then leave without a word, and
 she would have to listen to that baby (and the next baby and the baby after
 that, because

Aro,

 Relief flooded her, and she opened her mouth to thank him.

Brady tried not to look guilty while he waited for Addy and the witch she

 He was thirteen, five years below Italy's minimum driving age, and even

 He looked at the clock on the dashboard.
 Either the flight was a bit late or the witch was giving Addy trouble.
 The latter seemed likely.
 A

Brady decided, as he waited, that he didn't like the airport pickup job.
 The Volturi were still experimenting with what roles suited the wolves,
 as they'd never had any before and had suddenly come into rather a lot

 Brady thought it was a little sad that the wolf ability to go about unnoticed

 given what terminating such employment meant, but he tried not to dwell
 on it.
 They did have to eat.

 Someone else was sobbing and making intermittent pleas in what Brady thought
 might be Spanish.
 Actually, he was pretty sure it was Spanish.
 The witch was from Mexico.
 Addy talked to her, much less weepily, in the same language.

Alec was waiting in the garage when Brady pulled in.
 It was assumed -- if untested -- that he'd be able to pacify the witch
 so Addy could be free to do other things.
 As far as Brady knew, they were going to try that in the garage, and if
 it worked, Alec would carry the witch inside, as he was immune to his own
 power.

\begin_layout Standard
A storm of clichés presented themselves to describe the situation, but that

 In the moment, the important bit was that the witch (he didn't even know

The witch was safe in her hiding place and wouldn't trust Addy again.
 The vampires were both on their feet again, staring at him, taking a moment

 Brady didn't run.
 He'd been an accomplice in the girl's abduction to begin with, and as long

Siobhan was livid when she realized that the Scots were poaching on her

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The funny thing was, they might have gotten away with it, if they had been
 only a little careful.
 If they'd spread out their kills, or gone for the folks thereabouts who
 were dying of the runs anyway.
 But they were blatantly hunting people in clumps.
 Healthy adults, who Siobhan noticed missing when she passed through familiar
 villages checking up on the state of her domain, whose neighbors speculated
 about them in hushed tones, who went missing in groups of five and six

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She made up her mind that their refined tastes were going to end them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It didn't take her long to figure out how they were choosing their targets.
 They were working their way north, keeping coastal, striking about once
 a month.
 She fed heavily, farther inland, to keep her head around the humans of
 the likeliest subsequent village.
 And then she picked a surveillance point, high up with a view of all access
 to the settlement, and dug in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Scots came a week later, at dusk, in a tight pack of three.
 The leader was a little dark female who moved like a cat, and there were
 two males following her.
 Siobhan watched them approach at a leisurely stroll.
 Like they owned the place.
 From the way they walked together and looked around, they were none of
 them mates, just three singles.
 That would make it easier to leave one survivor to run home and tell tales.
 Whatever misinformation had led these infiltrators to believe it was clever
 to help themselves to 
\emph on
her

 resources needed correction.
 Badly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possibilities twisted through her mind.
 Three was a challenge.
 A witch among them was unlikely -- would probably have either covered their
 tracks better or been more blatant still.
 She could take out the female first, leave the males leaderless, take off
 one head, destroy the other male while the head watched, toss head and
 torso both into the ocean to float home, heal (maybe), and tell the story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She wasn't very worried about the arrogant female leader.
 Siobhan had seen the catlike gait before, and it was usually a sign of
 overconfidence -- it looked slick and self-assured, but it involved unnecessary
 motions, wasn't very efficient.
 Vamipres who walked like that didn't know how to discard style for force
 in a pinch.
 If they couldn't beat you with flair they couldn't beat you at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan had forced herself to walk, maneuver, and fight in the most direct
 (not 
\emph on
obvious
\emph default
, that would have gotten her killed -- just 
\emph on
direct
\emph default
) way possible until she'd beaten five territorial competitors who walked
 like that, and felt like she'd earned her flowing, smooth motion.
 She'd cleared out the rest of her island with panache, but the ability
 to fall back on brutal assaults and sheer power was there if she found
 a superior foe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She put her quiet gait to use: as the Scots approached the slumbering village,
 Siobhan crept perpendicular to their path.
 She'd intercept them half a mile away from the outermost house if they
 didn't notice her first -- and, as her gait against the ground was quiet
 and could have belonged to a wild animal, they might not.
 Not through all the trees.
 Or they might split up, come at the village from several angles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did split, the female carrying on with her straight trajectory and
 the males fanning out to circle around.
 One, the smaller of the two males, came directly towards Siobhan.
 How convenient that she wouldn't have to fight the whole group together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He walked to within a hundred feet of her, oblivious, and then she was on
 him and had his arms off and head wrenched from his shoulders in a second,
 and had made enough racket in so doing to attract the others' attention.
 The head bounced, and landed facing her, openmouthed in astonishment and
 staring but unable to cry out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan stamped on his spine to shatter his torso into a few extra pieces,
 rendering it untenable for his covenmates to put him back together during
 the fight, and charged to meet the approaching female.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This fight was longer.
 The coven leader did know a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But not enough.

Siobhan dispatched her in four seconds without collecting any scars, wondering
 where the third invader was.

 He was probably a bit slower on the uptake (she'd made sure she kept the

 If she could focus to the exclusion of blood, she could focus to the exclusion

 It did not

 She wasn't sure if they were still in Nashville at all, instead of having

 She wasn't sure if Alice and Jasper had elected to join the latter's old

 There was nothing left that could help find Elspeth in Nashville, but that

Now he figures that's better'n remembering what Alice felt.

 I feel awful complaining about it because I know I'd be just alike if anything

 Can't drop the subject.
 He ain't keeping control of the empathy neither.

He might just need a while longer away,

 Emmett speculated, glancing at Rosalie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Back before you and me were turned, Edward went off and ate humans and came
 back after a few years.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It was a weak comparison.
 Edward's issues were much more self-contained; Rosalie had listened to
 the story of his internal trauma with contempt, whereas she did sympathize
 with the circumstances that had driven Jasper away from the family and
 off the deep end.
 But it was the closest simile they could make.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

And I doubt he's easy to live in a permanent residence with while staying

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Rosalie murmured.
 It wasn't that she didn't want to patch up her family.
 It was just so destroyed already that attaching a broken Jasper to it didn't

We'll return this to the dealership,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Emmett said.
 It was phrased like a statement, but he was saying it to check for Rosalie's
 approval.
 If she fell in spontaneous love with the car, he was all set to buy it
 for her.
 He probably wouldn't raise more than a token objection if she wanted to
 steal it instead, or drive it off an embankment, or take out her frustration

They loitered in Nashville for two days, and then Rosalie said she was ready
 to go home, and they boarded another airplane headed back to Michigan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She walked the shore of Lake Huron exactly once.
 Any hint of a scent was long gone -- neither Elspeth nor the vampire kidnapper
 tended to shed dead skin or other debris that would hold the clue in place
 longer, the way a human would have.
 There was no point to the journey.
 She did it anyway, hearing her internal predictor of what Alice might say
 teasing her about being a masochist.
 But the walk didn't actually hurt.
 She didn't feel much of anything as she made the circuit, staring out at
 the water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was hard for Rosalie to be around Esme, who grieved, obviously and constantly
, for her lost grandchild, departed daughter, and mad son.
 She'd been wretched after Edward and Bella had died, too, but this only
 piled on more bereavement still, leaving the woman a woeful wreck.
 Rosalie didn't have the patience for it.
 She should have identified more with Esme, who had similar regrets to her
 adopted daughter about the sacrifice associated with immortality, and had
 lost the same people as Rosalie, but Esme's anguish was so 
\emph on
passive
\emph default
.
 She loitered around the house, bursting into fresh imitations of tears
 whenever an object reminded her of the absent child.
 She let Carlisle pet her and coo at her and try to cheer her up, doling
 out enough halfhearted smiles that he didn't assume he was having no effect.
 She waited, inactive, for the universe to bring her replacements.
 The way it had brought her facsimiles of children when her own real baby
 had died and she'd tried and failed to follow.
 Facsimiles like Rosalie herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rosalie couldn't mourn that way, and it made her itchy to be near Esme when
 she was doing it.
 So Rosalie went around the lake, and then she packed up all of Elspeth's
 belongings right down to the bath towels and the barettes and the panda-bear
 slippers and stowed the boxes in the basement.
 She personally tracked down every person who'd been on a boat on Lake Huron
 the day Elspeth disappeared and questioned them, even though the police
 had already done the same thing and come up empty.
 When she found the same nothingness they had, she dove 
\emph on
into
\emph default
 the lake and searched the floor of it for some dropped object that might
 be a clue.
 There were a lot of objects, but nothing that Elspeth had been wearing
 or anything Rosalie could identify as belonging to the abductor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emmett shadowed her during most of this, although she made her trip around
 Huron alone.
 He didn't talk much, waiting for her to tell him what she needed.
 She didn't talk much, finding that she couldn't come up with any needed

 Rosalie invented for herself passels of children, one at a time or in batches,

When Adelaide was two and Ritter fifteen, she was talking, but she didn't

 Adelaide instead listened to someone speak -- Ritter himself, or one of

 She'd pick a word, she'd repeat it singular and clear and perfect and

 She didn't cry if she'd spoken the word for some treat or toy and no one

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter didn't point out to anyone how strange this was.
 And then Adelaide got the cough, and couldn't talk at all.
 During, or after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It didn't seem to bother her, at age three or even later, that her throat
 was too damaged to form words.
 She developed an ad-hoc library of signs to communicate with the family,
 learned them quick and perfect (and 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 use those, instead of dropping them like she had her few spoken sounds).
 She heard perfectly well.
 She could be taught to do chores.
 She learned them fast, sitting watchful on a counter or a fence or a stool
 while someone showed her something, and then she'd do it herself, perfect
 and quiet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She watched everyone, and Ritter watched her, the greedy pull of her eyes.
 She would turn up with inexplicable skills.
 When she was seven it was discovered that she could, somehow, sew gloves:
 she wasn't quick with them, but they were neat and perfect.
 The nearest glover admitted that he'd found her lurking in his workshop
 watching him stitch, but swore that as soon as he'd noticed her he'd sent
 her running along.
 When she was nine she materialized the ability to dance, any dance one
 cared to name, with or without a partner and graceful and smiling and perfect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She slipped out more as she grew older, turned up everywhere from the blacksmith
's to the old widow's henhouse.
 There weren't enough signs for her to explain herself.
 Ritter asked her to try anyway, to somehow account for her need to be everywher
e and watch everything done, but she just waved him away, smiling a secret
 smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter got married when he was twenty-three (Adelaide was ten) and his wife
 moved into the family inn with him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adelaide watched her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four days later, Ritter's wife turned up dead.
 It looked like an accident, like she'd fallen and hit her head in the stables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter asked Adelaide if she'd seen it happen, but she just shook her head,
 wide-eyed: 
\emph on
no
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter wondered if she'd ever had the opportunity to watch a clever assassin
 at work, and shuddered and put it out of his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He remarried a year later, and the second wife didn't turn up dead and eventuall
y he had his own family to deal with.
 Two years after that, the senior Bauer died, and Ritter took over the inn.
 Adelaide and a brother and three sisters still lived there, but Ritter
 didn't pay them as much attention as he had in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adelaide turned fourteen, and then she disappeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter tore the town apart trying to find out who'd last seen his sister,
 and discovered that she'd been observed skulking about, following a traveling
 entertainer as he scoped out the best places to busk for coins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter couldn't leave the inn himself to look for his vanished sister, but
 he sent their brother Kaspar in the direction the entertainer had been
 seen to go.
 Kaspar was back a week and a half later with Adelaide perched behind him
 on the horse, smiling and carrying a fiddle that she could suddenly play
 (perfectly).
 Kaspar hadn't found the entertainer, but he'd encountered Adelaide, by
 herself, with the violin -- like she was waiting for him to pick her up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter admonished her not to go on wandering away by herself -- it was 
\emph on
dangerous
\emph default
, he or Kaspar might not be able to find her if she went far.
 Adelaide listened, or seemed to.
 She went on leaving home by herself, but as though to oblige him, she played
 her fiddle nearly everywhere she went, duplicating birdsongs and everything
 drunkards at the inn belted out and once seeming to memorize all the sheet
 music in the church.
 This made her somewhat easier to find.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adelaide was not an especially pretty girl, and while there were rude jokes
 swirling about town that her destroyed voice would make her an ideal wife,
 no interest was serious.
 She unnerved people, and could make a dreadful howling noise with her fiddle
 if she wanted someone to leave her alone (once she was bored with watching
 them, generally).
 She seemed uninterested in the prospect of marriage herself, shaking her
 head when Ritter asked.
 She didn't eat much, and inn patrons would throw money at her when she
 played music at home, so Ritter shrugged and decided to simply keep her
 where she was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When she was sixteen, Adelaide was found holding the broken pieces of her
 fiddle and standing over a man's body.
 He was one of the local farmers, a burly, rough man, and it was generally
 agreed that a girl Adelaide's size -- inclined a little to plumpness, but
 not tall, not strong -- couldn't be responsible.
 She managed to communicate by pointing and signing that he'd been drunk,
 and fallen, and knocked her instrument out of her hands in so doing and
 hit his head on a particular rock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter didn't think of his first wife in this context until the following
 month, at which point Adelaide had disappeared again and returned (unaccompanie
d) with a piccolo.
 She couldn't, or wouldn't, explain where she'd gone or where the pipe had
 come from, but she played it as prettily as she has the fiddle, of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was the last time Adelaide left town until she was twenty-one, and
 while Ritter wondered occasionally about his first wife and the drunken
 farmer, he mostly put it out of his mind.
 He had a lot else to think about, and Adelaide looked completely harmless,
 anyway.
 She did stare, but staring didn't hurt anyone.
 He'd never 
\emph on
seen
\emph default
 her hurt anyone, she only wanted to look around her and play music.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Adelaide was twenty-one a pale stranger with black eyes and unearthly
 grace came to town.
 He stayed at the inn, but ate nothing Ritter could see, and slept all day,
 and spoke with a strange accent that disappeared over the course of the
 first night he was there.
 He said his name was Lutz Kirsch, but Ritter wasn't sure he believed him.
 It didn't matter very much, though; he was secretive and strange, but his
 money jingled properly.
\end_layout

Lutz Kirsch -- or whatever his name was -- had Adelaide's 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on

\emph default
 she stared at him.
 Ritter didn't think she was suddenly interested in marriage -- she looked
 the same way at sheet music -- but she was interested in 
\emph on
something
\emph default
 about the stranger for certain, as though she didn't dare blink.
 Occasionally she'd lick her lips in the oddest way.
 Ritter sometimes saw her sitting outside the door to Lutz's room during
 the day when the man was asleep, with her ear pressed to the door.
 He didn't pull her away, as she'd only go back when he wasn't looking and
 Lutz hadn't complained, but it disturbed him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lutz appeared to ignore Adelaide, until he'd been in town for two days,
 and then it was though he was as intrigued by her as she was by him.
 He let her teach him all of her signs, and then between the two of them
 they invented more, until Ritter couldn't follow the conversation -- for
 Lutz was signing too, he could speak and she could hear but instead he
 was twisting his hands in the air for her to watch.
 She looked raptly, never seeming to miss a sign even though at least ninety
 percent of them had been invented an hour earlier.
\end_layout

Adelaide got up later every morning and stayed up later every night, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

talking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to their dark-eyed nocturnal guest who never looked rested, and Ritter's
 sleep crept forward too as he kept an eye on sister and stranger, but then
 his wife complained and he resumed a more normal schedule.
 Kaspar was up nights anyway, to have someone available to take in odd arrivals.

 Ritter asked Lutz, a few days later when he'd gotten up earlier than usual
 and Lutz was still awake.
 It hadn't occurred to him, before, that his silent littlest sister might
 be a good conversationalist, able to hold an otherwise bored man's attention
 for hours on end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Look,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ritter, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if you're -- you know -- you shouldn't be alone with her, all right? Flapping
 your hands at each other is fine, I guess, but make sure Kaspar is around

Lutz stared Ritter in the eyes, and said,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Good.
 But still -- I'll be checking in with Kaspar to be sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ritter, not at all sure that he'd actually extracted a concession.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course you will,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lutz, looking away.
 He glanced out the window, at the vaguely pinkish approach of dawn, and
 then covered a yawn with his hand and retreated to his room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kaspar reported only conversations, endless inscrutable conversations, for
 the three further nights Lutz remained in the inn.
 Then on the last day of his stay, he left, during a cloudy midafternoon.
 Coin sufficient to cover the visit was left in the room he vacated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adelaide was gone too, when Ritter looked for her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She left her piccolo behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four other people were missing, too, the same day -- the woodcutter and
 the butcher's eldest girl and a Jew from the north bit of town and the
 washwoman, all gone.
 Some people thought those four and Adelaide and Lutz were all victims of
 the same abduction, somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter thought differently, but he didn't know how to follow her anyway,
 or where to send Kaspar riding off to, and he had four children and a wife
 who thought Adelaide took up too much of his attention, and he had an inn
 to run, and he did have other sisters to worry about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He put Adelaide and her strange, watchful ways out of his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ritter didn't see his youngest sister again until six years later, when
 he'd just got past his fortieth birthday, his (second) wife and his firstborn
 daughter were both dead of the fever that was going around, and the inn
 had half burnt down and been rebuilt on a substantial loan, which he was
 able -- just barely -- to pay down every fortnight as required.
 He almost didn't notice her.
 He was going back to the inn from the baker's, having adjusted the inn's
 regular order for bread.
 It was a bit past nightfall, and he saw a flash of white out of the corner
 of his eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he looked around, Adelaide was standing at the edge of the road to
 the inn, smiling familiarly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If she hadn't been smiling he'd never have recognized her, because her face
 had changed, and she had her hair tied up in complicated braids that wrapped
 around her head, and her eyes -- he couldn't see the colors very clearly
 in moonlight, but they were darker.
 They used to be pale blue.
 She was more beautiful than she'd been, more self-assured in how she held
 herself.
 And she still looked twenty-one, not a bit like she'd been gone for half
 a dozen years.
 Ritter wondered if she'd died then, not just disappeared; if he was meeting
 her because he'd just now keeled over of a heart attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ritter,

I lost interest in him,

 she said, like she was explaining why she no longer played a certain piece

 Ritter noticed there was a flute -- made of glass, he thought, although
 it was hard to tell in the dark -- hanging from a cord looped around her
 waist, and she wasn't wearing any shoes.

 said Adelaide with a silvery laugh.
 She loped away.
 She wasn't going too fast -- Ritter could have caught up -- but she didn't
 give the impression of exerting herself either.
 Like she was a soap bubble.

Elspeth's power tasted bubbly and sweet but with an edge, like watermelon
 soda with a twist of lemon.
 (Addy was always intrigued by the way that powers tasted like

\emph on
actual
\emph default
 soda she'd have felt compelled to spit it out, but she could compare power-tast

 It was a cleaner taste than the cloying artificial-grape slush of Alec's
 power, which it first displaced.
 It was peppier than Renata's smooth cream, tarter than Chelsea's flavorless
 saccharine.
 It wasn't as intense as the shock of

Addy didn't use the power for anything immediately.
 She had to help track down the stray witches, and watermelon soda wasn't

 She did not

 having lost Vasanti (tastes like chicken) or Dwi (butter) or Benjamin (garlic

 she wasn't sure which represented which element, if it did at all).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She borrowed Jane (
\emph on

\emph default
) and gave chase.
 Demetri's power (red wine vinegar) would have been more helpful, but he
 was away doing...
 something...
 (Addy thought of rosewater and didn't know why).
 Jane's power would do the trick as long as she got within sight of the
 fleeing prisoners; it would pin them down until Alec caught up with her.
 Other guards would keep humans well back, leaning hard on the Volturi's
 network of influence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy, and the other guards on their own hunts, brought back almost everyone,

Addy wanted to know what the addition tasted like, so when she had a chance,

There were two besides herself (if that was the correct way to think of
 the division), and they both looked like Addy: one with a predator's smile
 and the other in the predator's clutches, limp and staring into space but
 not actually unconscious.
 Elspeth had names for hers, silly alliterative designations -- Addy named

 She needed to borrow Pera's (some sort of glazed meat, maybe apricot on
 mutton) to keep an eye on the reclusive new addition.
 She attended a small confrontation in the Alps for which she brought Zafrina's
 illusion power (tofu).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, regularly, she coaxed Elspeth and her accompanying beverage to greater
 heights of sweet-sour-cold-fizziness, adding new facets to the magic with
 dizzying rapidity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy did wonder, once, if powers other than Elspeth's would behave the same
 way that Aide did, letting Adele manhandle them while they relaxed and
 gazed neutrally at nothing.
 She couldn't check, since those powers didn't offer the same affordance
 to inspect them that Elspeth's did.
 Still, Charles's truth-detection (mustard) or Pyotr's compulsion (potato
 chips) and Emel's control of metal (pickles) seemed -- insofar as powers
 could have independent personalities -- like they might not tolerate this.
 But then, when Elspeth spoke to her own Magic, it (she?) didn't act like
 Aide did either.
 Aide wasn't 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 a version of Elspeth's Magic wearing Addy's face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then again, no one was holding Magic hostage, while Adele never let go of
 Aide given the chance to hold her.
 Magic's behavior might change if something equivalent were going on inside
 Elspeth's mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy was 
\emph on
annoyed
\emph default
 when she had to flee Volterra.
 But none of the powers she was leaving behind -- not the vanilla ice cream
 of Taamusi's freezing power, or Abdelmajid's marjoram x-ray vision, or
 Emere's invisible knife that tasted like celery -- was 
\emph on
changing
\emph default
.
 She could always remember those flavors, the way those powers stung her
 tongue when she took and wielded them.
 Elspeth's was 
\emph on
changing
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy didn't want to miss it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there was Maggie, whose power (supposedly like Charles's, but reversed;
 he detected honesty, Maggie detected lying) tasted like skim milk and didn't
 hold Addy's interest for more than a moment.
 And 
\emph on
then
\emph default
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan's flavor hit Addy over the head like an anvil, 
\emph on
bread
\emph default
, warm and yeasty and crisp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While intense, it was a plain taste, and Addy understood how someone who
 went around with something so 
\emph on
plain
\emph default
 might not notice it was there.
 Bread 
\emph on
carried
\emph default
 other flavors; one used it as a substrate for jam or cream cheese or peanut
 butter or tuna salad or leftover turkey, and Siobhan's magic didn't bring
 any of those items to the table by itself.
 Unobtrusively, it 
\emph on
carried
\emph default
 information about the world, turned it into a spread or a filling of something
 manageable.
 
\emph on
Plan sandwiches
\emph default

 So simple, so 
\emph on
useful
\emph default

 Addy abandoned Elspeth's fruity soda without a second thought.

 power would let her get it back, and more, if she played her cards right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She found Nathan, a stroke of very fine luck, and his power was mixed nuts,
 shifting between almond and pistachio and cashew and acorn and pecan and
 more whenever she posed it a question.
 She did miss the bready magic, but she wasn't liable to forget the plan
 she'd put together with its help; nutty timing power would be better for
 actually enacting it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And she sat back, and waited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She couldn't regret, much, the loss of many of the guards.
 She knew those tastes.
 There was a certain degree of annoyance at the deaths of Afton (pinto beans),
 Corin (parsley), and Heidi (fondant icing), among others...
 but Elspeth and her lovely, blossoming power were alive, as were many others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Including Bella.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Addy 
\emph on
knew
\emph default
 the self-styled Empress was a witch, and if she stood close enough to Bella,
 she could 
\emph on
almost
\emph default
 taste it...
 but 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 almost, and unlike every other witch she'd approached in her life, touching
 Bella did nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was 
\emph on
outrageously
\emph default
 frustrating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Addy knew she had otherwise made out extremely well, and pasted a smile
 on her face and worked hard and made do with the available smorgasbord.
 When Harry the minor tracker (who she'd tasted before, at La Push before
 he died; he was a mild blueberry) got his power back, she wasn't especially
 interested.
 Didyme was new to her, though: chocolate.
 (Of course, chocolate -- what else would an aura of happiness taste like?)
 And other witches crossed her path in the course of her duties as Imperial
 Factotum.
 She did a great deal of commuting, usually under the influence of Razi's
 salty magic, and there were new magics on a regular basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elspeth went on improving, after she became willing to resume her lessons
 (either reduced coercion or increased age slowed her down, but she did
 get better), and soon the hybrid represented an enthralling array of sweet
 fruits (as well as mint and rhubarb, technically vegetables) all whipped
 into a bubbly potion of versatile power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took nearly thirty years before Bella was able (or willing -- Addy didn't
 know how to distinguish the two) to let Addy in through her inner protection
 and sample that elusive shield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy licked her lips.

If you are filling out this form on behalf of another person, be aware that
 they will be investigated to confirm their consent, without which no turning

 The Golden Coven regrets that we cannot make exceptions for people who

 to secure consent from some persons who cannot be queried via ordinary
 means.

\emph on
Adults are not considered by the Golden Coven to have the power to consent
 on behalf of their minor children, nor to withhold such consent (although
 parental opinions will be sought under normal circumstances regarding applicant

 your case).
 Note that, regardless of consent, it is currently opposed to Golden Coven
 policy to turn anyone younger than 14 years of age.
 You may apply as or on behalf of such a person anyway if your circumstances
 are 
\emph default
highly

 Turnings of persons younger than 17 are subject to more scrutiny than applicati

Becoming a vampire is irrevocable.
 Becoming a vampire places you under the permanent jurisdiction of the Golden

 Angela hadn't personally seen the spa complex, but she'd heard of it.
 It was oddly placed, considering that it was so exclusive that no one who
 actually lived in Forks was allowed in and only seemed to be open two months
 out of every couple of years.
 Jessica (not exactly Angela's friend anymore, but they talked, sometimes;
 Jessica had a son in Angela's kindergarten) had gone up to it once while
 the lights were on.
 She'd been turned away by a snooty employee.

\begin_layout Standard
And so Angela hurried five-year-olds through fingerpainting and storytime
 and naps and counting and the alphabet, saw them all onto their buses,
 and then got into her little blue car and drove up to the spa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lady in the front office did not appear to have a chair behind her desk,
 which was strange.
 Her eyes were a rich gold (hadn't the Cullens had gold eyes, at least some
 of the time?), and she wore black hair in a long braid that contrasted
 with her frosty complexion.
 When Angela came in, the receptionist -- it seemed the likeliest job title

 She didn't see anything very spa-like, but this was only one building of
 several.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Past all these offices was just a hallway, with windows looking out onto
 the grounds.
 They were pretty lush with plant life, although it was mostly the sort
 that wouldn't require much maintenance -- trees and shrubs rather than
 grass that would need mowing or flowers that would need weeding.
 Angela supposed it would be expensive to have a gardener around all year
 when the spa was often closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Angela and the receptionist didn't encounter anyone in the hallway, but
 there were people flitting about behind the windows to the other buildings,
 uniformly pale people who moved like dancers just as the receptionist did.
 The air smelled like flowers, and a little shiver went up Angela's spine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Angela asked.

She's...

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recognition was immediate, and then second-guessed.
 Yes, the woman -- wearing, of all things, a 
\emph on
crown
\emph default
 wrought of gold on top of a perfectly ordinary jeans-and-t-shirt outfit
 -- looked like Bella.
 
\emph on
Except
\emph default
 Bella's eyes were brown (the crowned woman's were gold), Bella's hair was
 long (the crowned woman had a pixie cut), Bella's skin was pale but

\emph default
 and this person was bloodlessly white, and moreover, Bella should be almost
 thirty and this person was obviously a teenager.
 Bella had also not been quite that beautiful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Angela decided that this was some relative of Bella's -- a niece? Maybe
 Bella had an older sibling she'd never mentioned, who'd already moved away
 from home by the time Bella's mom had taken up with the baseball player,
 and the sibling had a kid who went around wearing a circlet and now worked
 for Bella at the spa (although the facility was 
\emph on
still
\emph default
 not particularly spa-like).
 Stranger things had happened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crown-clad woman watched Angela, who looked around at the others in
 the room.
 Edward -- no, not Edward, Edward would

 Edward Cullen was standing behind the girl who looked like Bella.
 There was a brown-eyed redhead girl, maybe eighteen or nineteen, standing
 between a man and a woman each in their mid-twenties who looked Quileute
 but not like any of the specific individuals Angela had seen prowling about
 town.
 Staring into space near the Bella-lookalike, although not as close to her
 as the Edward-lookalike, was a leggy brunette who didn't resemble anyone
 in particular, especially not with that vacant expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were others in the room, standing or sitting on the floor (there didn't
 seem to be any chairs), some with laptops plugged into outlets in the wall,
 everyone but the redheaded girl and her companions with their eyes black

What was that you said about Cuba, Alice...?

So, er, you're the Elspeth with the office I saw?

 Angela asked.

Mm-hm.
 Oh, and these are Jacob and Kelly,

 Elspeth added, gesturing at the following man and woman.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 said Angela.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elspeth's office was neat and luxurious, with deep carpet and a dark-stained
 desk and several matching cushy green chairs.
 Angela sat in one, grateful that chairs existed in the strange alternate
 universe she'd found herself in; Elspeth chose one opposite Angela, and
 the bodyguards fell into place behind their charge.
 (
\emph on

There are four ways to go about this,

 Elspeth said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

or any combination of the four.
 You can ask me questions, and I can answer them; you can read the pamphlets
 I wrote up which explain most everything, albeit impersonally; I can explain
 in approximately chronological order starting from the first time you were
 misinformed; or I can magically impart a summary of all the relevant informatio

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Angela stared at her, unable to detect deceit, even about the magic part.
 Feeling as though her throat were very dry, she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think I'll have a look at those pamphlets you mentioned.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Pamphlets were very ordinary things.
 One could find them on any number of subjects.
 Angela had a vivid memory of sitting in her college's infirmary, staring
 at a pamphlet about safe sex and marveling that it was able to make the
 most arresting topics sound not worth the trouble.
 That was just the thing needed for this situation.

\begin_layout Standard
Elspeth smiled, and fetched a stack of folded-up booklets from her desk,
 and Angela began to read.

\begin_layout Standard
Some hours later, Angela was sitting back in the front room with Santiago,
 having read a great many pamphlets and asked a great many questions and
 feeling remarkably unenlightened for it.
 She held a form, which purported to be her application to become a vampire,
 which had a variety of perks...
 and several serious drawbacks.
 Angela's on-again off-again boyfriend-who-might-propose-soon would probably
 not approve.
 It would make teaching kindergarten prohibitively difficult for a lengthy
 adjustment period.
 It was not conducive to producing a kindergartener of her own someday without
 elaborate interventions like the ones that explained Elspeth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Angela re-read the form several times, and then looked up at Santiago, who
 regarded her cordially.

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the winter of 1689 (not by the local calendar, but he wasn't

 human communities.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nearby
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by his standards: he traveled between them during the day, visited his
 lovers at night.
 They didn't know about each other, as it was easier to coax them into bed
 when he played the part of a supernatural being uncharacteristically charmed
 by their beauty with eyes for no other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't always bother with the coaxing.
 But he was beginning to suspect that it would make his successful conceptions
 less likely to drown themselves or slit their throats when they became
 aware that they carried his children, or even before.
 The death toll from the pregnancies which 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 suicide (or get themselves killed by outraged fellow humans) were already
 in the dozens, but he persisted: surely if it was possible for them to
 conceive, it should be possible for them to bear.
 The children at two weeks along -- as far as he'd seen any get -- were
 not strong enough to live apart from their mothers, however promptly Joham
 arrived on the scene to tear them out of the dead womb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when he did take the still bodies out of their mothers, they were perfect
 little creatures save for being dead -- vampire-like skin, but they would
 have breathed if they'd lived, their hearts would have beaten, who knew
 what else they might do? Who knew what marvels they'd have grown into?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Joham meant to find out, so: he left Pangari when dawn approached, promising
 to return to her in a few days.
 He spent the light of day traveling from where she lived to where Tathra
 lived, and came to her at dusk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except Tathra was, unaccountably, dead, with her belly ripped wide open,
 and beside her on the ground were several of her family, jagged scoops
 of their necks missing and surprisingly little blood pooling below the
 wounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Joham smelled the air, but there was no trace of any vampire having been
 in the place but himself.
 There were only the smells of blood (he controlled himself; he'd fed on
 his journey and there wasn't much left in these vessels anyway...
 but why? It hadn't 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 soaked into the ground...) and standard human odors of food and refuse and
 the like, and a sweet-spicy smell that was neither familiar nor important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So a vampire couldn't have killed them.
 Humans killed each other sometimes, but not like this, not typically.
 And a wild animal seemed...
 unlikely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He almost didn't examine Tathra's midsection more carefully.
 He would certainly have noticed if she had become pregnant, of course,
 would have noticed weeks ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except perhaps he wouldn't, because the hollow of the tear was lined with
 the damply glistening shell he'd become familiar with.
 How in the world...?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Joham ignored a sharp pain in his ankle and studied the scene.
 The bodies appeared to have been dead for different amounts of time.
 Tathra first, this fellow (a brother? He hadn't bothered to ask about her
 family) after her, then the woman (her aunt, he thought); then the girl
 perhaps ten years old (maybe Tathra's niece?) was still warm.
 Something had killed that girl not an hour before his arrival.
 He was entirely baffled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pain in his ankle subsided.
 He looked at the ring of punctures while they healed, then put his foot
 back down; it didn't matter where they'd come from and they were recovering
 normally.

He dropped his arms to his sides, blinking.
 He wasn't usually given to talking to himself, and he wasn't grief-stricken

 At any rate, whatever had killed her and her relatives, it wouldn't look
 good to the Volturi if he just fled the scene and it somehow led the local
 population to believe in blood-drinking monsters.
 It wasn't

He visited his other women in their customary order: one fell pregnant and

She'd evidently been continuing to feed herself -- come to think of it,

 It had to be magic, that was obvious.
 And a particularly insidious sort: he could now remember her attaching

 she'd seemed inconsequential.
 The humans had apparently been affected the same way.
 It would have been easy to lose her.
 But she'd apparently been motivated to stay with him, and successful at

It was a romantic notion, perhaps his only one, but he liked the idea of

Allirea nodded.

I dream.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She dreamed of being awake, mostly, only nothing she made was still there
 in the morning and nothing she'd learned was still true.
 Sometimes she had terrible dreams, where someone had seen Father do something
 he shouldn't have been able to do, and she couldn't make the fading cover
 him, and everyone looked at him and shouted and brought fire to kill him.
 Sometimes she dreamed about wandering around in the place she was from,
 by herself, with no Father at all because he hadn't come back for her or
 she'd let go while he ran.
 Sometimes she dreamed that they ate all the humans in the world and he
 starved and she had to eat bread that tasted sour and dry and sticky.
 She wasn't sure it was such a good thing to dream.
 But if Father wished to dream, she was lucky to do so.
 Allirea filed away this blessing with the others he'd told her she -- and
 her new sister, now -- had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had nothing more to say, so she relaxed and Father's eyes unfocused
 and slid away from her, and he looked at Noemi, and Allirea looked at her
 too.

\begin_layout Standard
Noemi almost didn't get to meet Nahuel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time Nahuel was born in 1853, Noemi was busily playing house with
 her vampire paramour -- not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but wasn't Father proof that mating wasn't strictly necessary? -- in Warszawa.
 Noemi's childhood had been full of loving attention from said father and,
 sometimes, her sister, but she'd always found the running around the world
 between batches of potential-mothers-of-more-siblings 
\emph on
tiring
\emph default
.
 Allirea could hitch a ride whenever she liked and never be told to get
 off their father's back, but Noemi'd had to run to keep up since she turned
 four.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So she'd broken a little rule -- just one of Father's, which would get her
 scolded, not one of the Volturi's that could get her killed -- and she'd
 let on to a vampire what she was.
 Jarek held the territory around Warszawa by himself, without the aid of
 a coven, which she found impressive.
 He was quite willing to let a fetching, 
\emph on
exotic
\emph default
 immortal like Noemi charm him into an explicitly temporary affair.
 Temporary because sooner or later, even if they never really 
\emph on
tired
\emph default
 of each other, Jarek or Noemi or both would find a mate.
 They agreed in advance that this was to be accepted without rancor on both
 sides when the time came.
 He was charmingly reasonable about it, Noemi thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Father had sighed and paced and shaken his head at Noemi, but finally he'd
 agreed to leave her behind in Poland.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will come here to look for you the next time I am near,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said to her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I do not find you here -- if you have moved, perhaps -- then we will
 work out something else to find one another.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And they had decided on a series of landmarks to check, any one of which
 was unlikely to disappear soon, and signs that could be left near them
 to indicate updated locations.
 Father was gone as soon as his last Polish experiment choked on her own
 blood and died, a week and a half along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noemi found that stationary life agreed with her very well.
 She slept during the day, in Jarek's cellar hideout, and when it was too
 sunny for him to venture out he would stay in and hold her.
 At night she woke, and they hunted together, and played absurd games of
 hide-and-seek that sprawled across the entire city, and Jarek repeatedly
 lauded his good fortune at having found a warm and durable bedmate without
 having to wait for the whims of whatever controlled mating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last eventually resulted in Noemi becoming pregnant, which was alarming
 to the both of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Jarek said.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Noemi laughed, because he

 funny, even when the situation could be deadly serious.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I feel healthy enough,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said, running a hand over her distended belly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm stronger than a human.
 Maybe I can survive it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noemi stayed in the cellar, and Jarek brought her food enough to satisfy
 her increased cravings, and she continued to feel healthy (if a bit bloated).
 The baby (Noemi named it in advance like her mother had done for her, just
 in case: Kanimir if a boy, Jaromira if a girl) grew fast.
 Faster than Noemi had seen Father's other attempts at children do.
 But as long as she kept eating -- especially first thing every evening
 when she woke up -- she felt...
 fine.
 The baby didn't break her bones or rupture her organs or drain the life
 out of her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kanimir was born three weeks and two days after he was conceived.
 Noemi had warned Jarek about her kind's propensity for 
\emph on
chewing
\emph default
, and when she felt the first stab of agony he tore her open as neatly as
 he could with his teeth.
 When Kanimir was safely out and wriggling happily on the floor beside his
 mother, Jarek held the edges of the wound together, Noemi panted and scrunched
 her eyes shut, and a jagged scab formed and started to scar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once Noemi could sit without opening herself up again, Jarek went out for
 more prey: for her, to recover, and for the baby.
 Kanimir was small and symmetrical and looked like he was made of porcelain.
 He had his mother's blonde hair, and black eyes that didn't change color
 when he fed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noemi's scar didn't go away, although it did get thinner and turn white.
 It was colder than the rest of her, probably the result of the venom Jarek
 had bitten in.
 She did return to her original, svelte shape over several days.
 Kanimir's shell was apparently absorbed back into her body without incident.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The little family was very paranoid about letting Kanimir be seen for his
 first few years of life, when someone might have mistaken him for a full
 vampire -- and an immortal child, based on his size.
 But he grew even faster than Noemi had.
 He was three when he finally looked fourteen: the cutoff age, beyond which
 it was permissible to turn.
 Anyone making the obvious mistake would not make it to the point of having
 the child executed for a capital crime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wouldn't be a hard mistake to make.
 Kanimir didn't have a heartbeat.
 He wasn't 
\emph on
cold
\emph default
, like a vampire, but he did tend to hover around room temperature.
 He ate less often but more avidly than Noemi did, and had almost his father's
 grace and speed, albeit not strength.
 He slept -- occasional, optional catnaps he could have whenever he chose
 in opposition to Noemi's rigid nocturnal schedule, the naps totaling no
 more than an hour a day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jarek was full to bursting with pride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wanted another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noemi...
 did not.
 She was pleased with Kanimir.
 He was a delightful child, always ready with a kiss for his mama and a
 new discovery about the world to cheer about.
 But even knowing that, for her, motherhood was survivable, she didn't want
 to repeat the experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her relationship with Jarek didn't long survive the moratorium on lovemaking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't push the issue.
 He could have, but either lingering affection for Noemi, or fear of Joham,
 or some combination, prevented it.
 They went on living together amicably, and raised their child cooperatively,
 but ceased to be lovers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kanimir stopped growing when he was five and could pass for eighteen.
 In indirect sunshine, he glowed like Noemi; under high noon on a cloudless
 day there was a twinkly sheen to him like crushed white mica.
 He wore his hair long and went barefoot and tasted human food just once.

Kanimir ate the bread, and didn't feel compelled to choke it up later, but

 Kanimir decided finally, and both of his parents had to be satisfied with
 that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noemi had crossed oceans before.
 The usual method was for Father to tow a boat with her on it, and a few
 humans tied up to eat on the way in case they didn't encounter any ships
 to hunt on.
 A larger raft was called for with Kanimir in tow, but otherwise the procedure
 was the same.
 They took the trip at a leisurely pace to let the untraveled quarter-human
 see the sights on the way, and stopped in France for Father to begin and
 kill off a round of experiments, and then they went across the Atlantic
 and landed on the wrong coast of South America.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They went across, slowing down and meandering north-south more as they got

One evening, Noemi woke up to find Allirea unfaded, a vampire woman in their

 He agreed to check it

periodically".
 Noemi suspected that he didn't intend for that to amount to anything frequent,
 but there was a glimmer of something in his eyes when he looked at how
 she touched Kanimir's hair, or how proud Father looked when he placed his

 She thought he'd probably look in more often than he meant to when he promised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The family left Nahuel to reconstruct his aunt, and traversed the sea again

 Kanimir parted ways from his mother and grandfather when they landed in

\begin_layout Standard
The first time Allirea was away from her father for more than a day was
 in 1910.
 She'd always been afraid of losing him.
 He'd tear apart the Earth to find her again, of course -- if she could
 stay unfaded long enough to let him remember that she was lost.
 She couldn't.
 Sleep, if nothing else, would end the constant expenditure of willpower
 that it took to remain noticeable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But in 1910, she decided that it was safe to leave him.
 If she couldn't find him again where she expected him to be right away,
 she could go to Warszawa by herself and wait until he visited her nephew.
 Or to Nahuel's home in Chile, which Father also visited sometimes.
\end_layout

So, that winter, she unfaded and waited for Father's acknowledgement.

Father didn't usually keep a schedule in advance, but he worked one out
 anyway, on the spot, and she memorized the plan, and he swore -- to Noemi,
 so he could remember -- that he would stick to that itinerary.
 And then Allirea relaxed, and the chess game resumed, and she hugged them
 both unawares and steeled herself to march out of the hotel room they were
 keeping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She kept track of where she went, so she wouldn't become lost and unable

 Eventually she wound up on a boat to Puerto Rico.

She didn't have anything planned for what to do with herself there.
 So she did what she always did: watched, without being watched herself.

People-watching without Father around was a different experience.
 He always told her and Noemi that humans were animals, food, experimental

 Allirea did eat in Puerto Rico, of course.
 But she also noticed other things, without Father there to act as a lens.

Orlán was

 insidious humor.
 Inside of a week of first seeing him, she watched no one else.
 She slept next to him, though he didn't know it.
 When he cooked at his chef's job she tasted what he made, out of sentiment,
 even though it was all inferior to warm, sweet blood.
 And he made jokes, for his friends and his little brother and his nieces,
 and Allirea laughed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She decided that she wanted Orlán to make jokes for

 Only when no one else was around, snippets of ten and fifteen minutes during
 most days.
 He was convinced he was imagining her, or daydreaming her, since he couldn't
 introduce her to anyone and never seemed to recall her existence for long
 -- but that didn't stop him from talking to her.
 It didn't stop him from making jokes.
 And she laughed, and eventually she decided to kiss him, and she decided
 that Noemi had 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They enticed each other to bed over several weeks (she didn't mention that

 Orlán was engaged, but Allirea was an unusually solid fantasy, so he thought

 He did not accept that at all, and, confronted with Allirea's reality,
 wanted nothing else to do with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea could still 
\emph on
watch
\emph default
 Orlán if she wanted.
 He could hardly stop her.
 She could even lift his spirits in spite of his preoccupation with his
 child out of wedlock, if she folded the baby into her own protection.
 When their son was forgotten like she was, Orlán would joke as he had before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She faded into the background, and protected their son the same way as much
 as she could, until Orlán's wedding.
 Then she left town.
 She didn't want to watch him living with 
\emph on
her
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But she did name the baby after his father.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea was awkward in attempting to raise little Orlán.
 Whenever she relaxed for a moment, he thought he was alone, and cried.
 He slept, but at seemingly random times, and it was almost impossible for
 him to wake her up in the middle of the night when he opened his eyes and
 feared the dark or wanted food.
 When he learned to crawl, climbing and walking followed soon after, and
 she had to put him in what amounted to a cage before she went to sleep
 to prevent him from haring off into the darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If she took him into a populated area, she had to fade him or unfade herself.
 Humans would try to grab her son right out of her arms if she did neither,
 because there was an 
\emph on
unattended child
\emph default
, and they had to find his parents, of course.
 Especially because he was an unattended, 
\emph on
cute
\emph default
 child: he had thick black hair that curled when it got long, and though
 he didn't glow in the sun, he did have a healthy clay-colored complexion,
 midway between Allirea's nut brown and his father's deep tan.
 He wasn't the ethereal vision of beauty that a vampire was, or the solidly
 healthy and even-featured specimen that first-generation hybrids seemed
 to turn out to be, but he was extraordinary if mistaken for a human.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Little Orlán drank blood quite happily (which didn't affect his brown eyes
 a bit), but he also enjoyed select human foods that Allirea was, at best,
 neutral about.
 She let him have them when he asked.
 They didn't do him harm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It became easier to care for him as he learned to talk.
 He started with Spanish, but once he had a solid command of that at six
 months old, she taught him her first language to use instead, the Aboriginal
 tongue her mother had spoken.
 Orlán speaking Spanish sounded a little too much like his father and Allirea
 didn't like to hear it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was slower and weaker than her even as he grew up, and sometimes he forgot
 things -- not random, background things, like the ones Allirea could forget,
 but occasionally even important things.
 He still had a better memory than a human, as far as she could tell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Orlán was ten and looked twenty, he stopped growing.
 He was tall, topping Allirea's five foot two by almost eighteen inches.
 He moved easily among humans, telling the right lies and hiding the full
 extent of his abilities.
 But he wasn't shy about demonstrating them, up to the limits Allirea guessed
 were safe and carefully instilled into his memory using the techniques
 that would let her admonishment stick when her existence didn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he was eleven, he went into a town by himself, got a job fishing, and
 was gone for a week and a half before Allirea figured out where he'd gone.
 He came back to the house she'd built them in the safety of the middle
 of nowhere, blinked at her when she reasserted her presence, and apologized
 for scaring her, but he went back out when she dropped her unfading again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea thought about it long and hard, but eventually she decided to let
 him be.
 Carefully, she left instructions for how to find his cousin in Warszawa,
 or his uncle in Chile, and where he should leave a note when he decided
 to move somewhere new, so she'd be able to find him again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then she got on a boat to Portugal, and waited in Sintra for Father and
 Noemi, who arrived on schedule and were pleased to see her again.
 They wanted to visit Orlán, so they did, although Allirea hung back beyond
 what she needed to do to introduce everyone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea left them twice more: once in Uruguay in 1939, and once in South
 Africa in 1990 not long after Iseul was born.
 (Allirea was not especially fond of Iseul, at least compared to Noemi,
 and that time she left at least as much to get away from the excessively
 perky child as she did to enjoy herself in Cape Town.) Each time she left,
 she followed a man.
 An 
\emph on
unattached
\emph default
 man -- she'd learned her lesson.
 Each time she eventually revealed herself, eventually made love to him,
 inevitably got pregnant, and bore a daughter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ella, the first daughter, was actually quite welcome to her father Camilo,
 who had the freedom to be eccentric that came with self-made wealth and
 wasn't much harmed by a daughter of mysterious origins or put out by the
 inconvenience of hiding her age.
 In order to placate Camilo's sensibilities, Ella was raised entirely on
 human food supplemented with occasional pigs' blood.
 Allirea was able to leave Ella with Camilo -- and with a mostly fictional
 explanation of why the girl would grow so fast and be so extraordinary
 -- and so Ella didn't have the difficult childhood her brother had.
 She grew up surprisingly human in outlook.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, Camilo was entirely able to manage their daughter, and everything
 else, without Allirea at all, which went a long way to disenchanting her
 with him.
 He was no happier when she was noticeable than when she wasn't.
 Allirea stayed in Uruguay, despite her lost interest in Camilo, until Ella
 was grown and in spite of the girl's alien identification with the animals
 around her.
 Allirea made sure that her second child had the same resources Orlán did
 to get ahold of her mother's side of the family.
 But Allirea herself felt superfluous, and so after her daughter turned
 ten, she went to Puerto Rico to update Orlán on his sibling status, and
 then met up with Father and Noemi in La Paz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siphiwe, Allirea's last daughter, was not such a pleasant addition to 
\emph on
her
\emph default
 father's life, but Allirea didn't have to raise her alone as she had with
 Orlán after being turned out of her lover's house.
 She brought baby Siphiwe with her to Namibia, where Father and Noemi and
 Iseul lingered, and convinced Noemi to live with her in South Africa and
 help until Siphiwe was ready to be on her own.
 Father wasn't thrilled with the geographical requirement, but in order
 to stay near his elder daughters he confined himself and Iseul to the southerly
 half of Africa for the next decade.
 Noemi and Allirea set up in Port Elizabeth, and Siphiwe grew up thinking
 of Noemi as as much of a mother as Allirea was -- more so, when Allirea
 was faded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea's children all met each other once: in 2000, when Siphiwe was grown
 (and so was Iseul), Allirea declared an unprecedented family gathering,
 and got Father and Noemi and Nahuel and Kanimir and Iseul and Orlán and
 Ella and Siphiwe to congregate in Natal, Brazil, a reasonable geographic
 midpoint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a lukewarm event.
 Father was excessively self-congratulatory about the quantity and quality
 of his descendants.
 Orlán didn't seem to like having sisters, and Ella, who'd had half-siblings
 on her father's side and hadn't liked them much, wasn't interested in developin
g new relationships of the same kind.
 Siphiwe hated travel and desperately wanted to go home, and Nahuel wouldn't
 stop worrying about having offended Huilen by attending the gathering.
 Kanimir was annoyed at Allirea (whenever he recalled her presence) for
 not inviting his father Jarek.
 Iseul took an immediate shine to her nieces and nephews and seemed oblivious
 to how annoying they found her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But everyone was there, and everyone exchanged contact information and got
 to know each other and memorize their network of relationships, which was
 what Allirea wanted.
 That way, she could expect to find anyone in her family through anyone
 else, if she lost touch somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allirea faded out, and followed her father and sisters as they left Natal.

And so when Demetri found her in the street in Bayankhongor, and called
 her name, and she saw the black cloak...
 Iseul wanted to run.
 But she couldn't get away from a vampire, so she was polite to him and
 did as he asked, and then he called Jane and jumped out the window looking
 intent on something Iseul couldn't place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Iseul huddled next to Noemi on the couch, worried about Jane's approach,
 wishing Father would return home sooner than planned.
 It would be no good to leave town hoping to avoid meeting the Volturi weapon;
 Demetri found them once and would have an even easier time finding them
 again.
 They would just have to be very polite to her and hope the Volturi didn't
 want to hurt them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jane did want to hurt them (although not damage them).
 She took exception to Iseul drifting off to sleep at six in the morning
 before she was done talking to them, and wouldn't even let Noemi try to
 wake her before resorting to her usual bludgeon.
 Sleep insistently clawed at Iseul from one direction and Jane's fire from
 the other.
 Noemi had learned to stay up past 
\emph on
her
\emph default
 usual bedtime with practice, but Iseul couldn't do it.
 When the little witch finally left with her companions at her heels, Iseul
 couldn't stop trembling, and she felt more tired than she ever had before,
 but it was almost noon and she couldn't make herself fall asleep at the
 wrong time.

After she got a morning's sleep, she felt better, but still unsettled, and
 the feeling didn't go away after another day, or a week, or a year.

Joham was mildly put out about the new regime, until it became clear that

 That, with the fact that he was demonstrably willing and able to raise
 his children alone and didn't require ongoing participation from the mother,

\begin_layout Standard
Still, most of them backed out after talking to him, although one wavered
 enough that she got as far as meeting his daughters before changing her
 mind, and one appeared set to go through with it until a vampire mated
 to her and got her through the screening process that way.
 Joham was patient, though.
 The new arrangement would be unlikely to lose any of his precious children
 once he got to the point of creating them, and would probably improve his

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was eight years into the new system before he finally got his fifth child.

There was a reasonable number of half-vampires by then, and while the princess

 Joham settled into a residence within the environs of the cluster, and

David hissed at her and backed up several feet without getting up from his

 He jerked convulsively and rolled over on the carpet, then sprang to his

Tanya shook her head and put down the remote.
 She might have to switch to watching her films in one of the other houses
 as long as David was around, if he was going to react like that to every
 fictional growling creature.
 At least Kate could handle him easily.
 When Kate was gone, hunting or picking up men or running errands, Tanya
 and at least one helper were required to keep the newborn in line.
 A helper other than Laurent, who didn't stop hitting until his opponent

\begin_layout Standard
Harry made eight.
 He was more controlled than David by a long shot.
 Kate smacked him around preemptively when he paced too energetically or
 growled -- often at his computer, which Carmen had given him as a hand-me-down
 and which he was using to keep in touch with...
 someone.
 It wasn't clear who, but he swore that he wasn't endangering the secret
 of vampire existence, so they let him have his privacy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry got along well enough with Carmen and Eleazar, who were less prone
 to attacking him whenever he made a nonverbal noise, but Tanya rubbed him
 the wrong way somehow, Kate was too trigger-happy, Laurent's diet made
 him uncomfortable, and Irina had nothing in common with him at all.
 Once he was proven capable of being around humans he started going for
 long hikes through the park alone.
 He texted confirmations that he hadn't killed anyone every few hours, but
 was often gone for days at a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, he didn't come back, and the texts stopped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tanya waited until it had been almost three days, with Harry not answering
 his phone once, before she became worried enough to call Carlisle.
 Carlisle consulted Alice and Alice foresaw Harry running south, almost
 to Washington.
 At least he was safe, but Tanya wondered if he'd eaten someone and was
 running out of shame...
 but then surely he didn't think they'd reject him over that? They put up
 with Laurent when he was home.
 On Irina's behalf, but still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was nearly a day later when Harry called Eleazar and announced belatedly
 that he was reducing their number to seven, and disconfirmed her theory
 about his dietary strictness.
 Tanya couldn't manage to regret the eventuality.
 Harry would be fine on his own, and he hadn't fit in well with their household,
 and this way he was happier and so were they without anyone having to actually
 evict him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
David calmed down considerably when there wasn't another newborn around.
 Harry's power had made him effective at avoiding direct contact with David,
 but David still knew he was there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tanya decided to risk turning on her own television again, as a test of
 David's improvement, and was able to watch forty-five minutes of a movie
 before he freaked out and needed Kate to swat him down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tanya wondered why Harry had been so unusually controlled.
 Bella was odd, and the even newer member of the Cullen family, Ilario,
 also odd, but from what Tanya understood they'd both known about vampires
 ahead of time.
 Surely Harry hadn't? Maybe Bella had talked to him while he turned, and
 that was enough?

David wasn't happy about four new vampires -- well, he'd

 and Laurent's old house.
 However, he was instantly taken with Elspeth, who made a round ten residents.
 He had an unprecedented run of good behavior, trying to prove to an overprotect
ive Rosalie that it was safe to let him hold the baby.
 Rosalie wouldn't go so far as to leave the room Elspeth was in, whether
 it was David or anyone else playing with her, but she did eventually let
 David pick the child up and talk to her.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Reminds me of my niece,

 he explained to Tanya, once, when she asked, not meeting her eyes.
 He shrank away from Tanya, slunk up to his room; he'd long recognized that
 while she didn't have Kate's unfair advantage, she was still his better
 if he turned it into a confrontation.
 But around Elspeth he didn't act like a newborn at all.
 She was in a third category apart from vampires, who were threats, and
 humans, who were prey, and he didn't have any instincts installed to deal
 with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tanya herself was only a little interested in Elspeth.
 The girl started walking -- toddling around everywhere with Rosalie trailing
 her tirelessly, and when she pestered Tanya instead of one of the nine
 other adults at her disposal, Tanya hid things and sent her to find them,
 deploying increasingly complex clues as Elspeth got smarter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Tanya spent more of her time commiserating somberly with Kate and Carlisle
 and Esme.
 They were pretty sure Irina was dead.
 They'd lost Edward and Bella.
 And the sisters -- the remaining sisters -- had Sasha's death in their
 memories too.
 Carmen and Eleazar did mourn Irina, but...
 as a

 Rosalie and Emmett had lost a brother and a sister too, but...
 there was Elspeth, at least for Rosalie, compensating.

The comfort of sharing grief old and new wore off fast, and the Cullens

Tanya and Kate, Carmen and Eleazar, and David.
 Five.

The Denalis were still five when visitors began to pour in again, half a

Tanya felt sick at heart about the betrayal they were committing -- of their
 cousins, of David even because Kate didn't yet feel sure of his loyalties
 and they did need one person with clear thoughts.
 And she wasn't going to soothe herself with beribboned words for it other
 than 
\emph on
betrayal
\emph default

 But she was trapped, they were all trapped.
 The Volturi were too powerful to be opposed.
 There was no hope for Carlisle or anyone who followed his madly idealistic
 scheme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It stung, like nothing else, that of all the people they learned were alive
 after having thought them dead, Irina wasn't among them.
 Why Edward, and not Irina? Why Alice, and not Irina? Why Elspeth, and not
 Irina...?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tanya had moved Irina's things back into her old room in the middle house
 when the Cullens came to stay so the third house, built for Irina and Laurent,
 could be used for the guests.
 Apart from this relocation, nothing had been touched.
 Not one possession of Irina's had been discarded.
 Tanya dusted every day, except when Kate did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Santiago and her wolves took David, who had stayed, who had become
 part of the family, who was her brother -- stepbrother? -- and she was
 only more trapped, and she often sat in Irina's room instead of her own.
 They were four, but surrounded, hemmed in by too many others, riddled with
 missing pieces that the intruders couldn't begin to replace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even as vampires of Carlisle's acquaintance poured in, taking up space,
 Tanya didn't let them spill into Irina's...
 storage room.
 The third house was open; let them use that.
 There were truly

 rooms in her and Kate and David's house, and in Carmen and Eleazar's, they
 could use those.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tanya didn't realize Kate had mated to visiting nomad Garrett (and that
 made five again, while David was gone) until she caught the pair of them
 in Irina's room.
 They weren't

 serious going on than her deciding to try the chillier end of the temperature
 spectrum in her choice of partners.

Kate apologized, not very sincerely.
 Tanya waved it off.
 Garrett seemed a tolerable sort.
 It could have been worse.
 It could have been someone who was going to go off on long, dangerous adventure
s, get himself torn to bits by wolves, and lead Kate after him and her sister
 both into death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Garrett distracted Kate from worrying about David, which was good.
 There was no benefit to worrying about David, and Tanya's bad luck at having
 no mate to divert her didn't need to extend to her remaining sister.
 David would be returned to them once things...
 settled down.
 Then they would be six.

Molly had not expected the convention to be

crowded

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had a Golden Coven password; she could get into the genealogical database
 that they maintained.
 She knew about Joham's kids (Noemi, Nahuel, Iseul, Joham Jr.) and about
 Princess Elspeth (whom she had 
\emph on
met
\emph default
, albeit when she was two, but no one was impressed because everyone who
 might be impressed was not allowed to know) and Cody Clearwater.
 She knew Joham had grandkids and great-grandkids, although she hadn't memorized
 the number.
 She knew Marcus had daughters.
 She was aware of a half a dozen other families with mixed children established
 since the Empress's takeover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had not been aware that when one put all of these individuals and their
 parents and spouses and siblings and children and miscellaneous extended
 family in a hotel, that the hotel would buzz with activity; that the halls
 would be full of 
\emph on
people
\emph default
 in twos and threes and throngs; that the beach, too, would be seething
 with them when she peeked out the hotel window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objectively it wasn't that many.
 Her school had more.
 When Uncle Ilario took her to the West End to see plays, the theaters --
 let alone Piccadilly Circus -- had far more.
 But 
\emph on
those
\emph default
 were 
\emph on
humans
\emph default
, and that made it different, somehow.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vampires
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 included her parents, her aunt and uncle, a handful of friends of the family
 who visited every year or two for miscellaneous holidays.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Crowds
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 included none of these people.
 Crowds were mundane and mortal and ran at thirty-seven degrees.

\begin_layout Standard
At first, it made Molly uncomfortable that everyone who looked at her could
 tell she was human.
 Then it occurred to her that 
\emph on
everyone
\emph default
 who looked at her could tell she was a human: people not

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She settled into the hotel room.
 She was sharing one with Petra and Julian, their parents in separate rooms
 to give the kids a home base from which to make friends without adult interfere
nce.
 Petra and Julian had handed off their luggage to Ilario and gone tearing
 down towards the water, bathing suits under their clothes, without even
 looking at the hotel.
 Molly took a few minutes to check out the room and, through glass, watch
 her cousins get into a splash fight.
 Then she peeled out of her clothes, slathered on three layers of sunscreen,
 shimmied into her brand-new bathing suit, and walked to the beach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She didn't recognize anyone.
 She knew roughly who was supposed to be present, and she could guess, but
 she could only guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were a few hybrids similar in apparent age to her.
 She saw a pair of golden-skinned girls with lustrous black hair, almost
 identical but not quite, sunning themselves glowily on a giant beach towel
 in matching swimsuits.
 They looked fourteen, were probably four.
 A younger boy -- looked twelve, probably three -- who could plausibly have
 been made out of polished maple wood was out in the water surfing expertly.
 Adults (various colors, but all with the sheen of hybrids or the shimmer
 of vampires) were sitting in the sand or wading with smaller hybrid children
 in the water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molly dug her toes into the sand and wondered what to do.
 This wasn't like going to school at the beginning of the year, when she
 could lean over in her first class of the day, and say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hi, I'm Molly.

Julian had started excitedly talking to the boy on the surfboard, and Molly
 could just hear him over the waves: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hi! I'm Julian! I'm not even a little bit a vampire but my mum and dad are
 vampires and me and my sister are adopted and we're gonna be vampires later

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The last was said pointing at the surfboard, and the boy, who introduced
 himself as Joey, agreed and ran off to get a spare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 be like leaning over in class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Petra, generally more interested in the company of adults (who did not tease
 about chicken pox scars) than children, was talking to some hybrid woman
 under a beach umbrella, but Molly decided to go over to the golden maybe-twins.
 They had their faces turned towards each other and were whispering quietly.
 The one whose face Molly could see seemed like her entire countenance was
 designed to show off her huge teak eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

H-hi.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Molly managed, and the nearer girl sat up and the farther with the huge
 eyes peered around her sister.
 The sitting hybrid looked very like the other, although she had her hair
 cut a few inches shorter and her lips seemed set in a constant pout.
 Molly suddenly felt very ugly.

 Julian was not having much luck with surfing, and the boy kept catching

Of course,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Pleione said, and the sisters started pointing at and naming and describing
 everyone on the beach.
 There was Siphiwe, Joey's niece.
 That nearly-human young woman was another grand-niece, descended from Siphiwe's
 half-sister Ella.
 There was Nahuel's vampire wife (
\emph on
not
\emph default
 mate, nor vice-versa, they were careful to specify) and their quarter-vampire
 son from before she turned.
 This last seemed vaguely scandalous to the sisters, that there was a vampire
 married to someone not her mate, but they'd married before conceiving the
 child, expecting her to survive the pregnancy without the aid of venom
 and turning out to have miscalculated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They described witchcrafts and life histories and personalities and proclivities.
 This one liked to visit their house to sit within Didyme's range and bask
 in the happiness; that one could sing at exacting pitches to shatter selected
 things with supernatural reliability; the other over there was an amateur
 marine biologist, using vampire capacities to dive unaided and investigate
 the deeps.

\begin_layout Standard
So Molly stumbled through a summary: uncle Ilario got cancer which prompted
 Mamma to go looking for vampires and find them; the Empress, before she
 was Empress, pulled Gianna out of Italy on the grounds of needing a surrogate
 mother for the Princess when the Volturi had tried to kill her; Mamma had
 talked the Cullens into saving uncle Ilario, and Mum had visited and mated
 to her, and then she'd given birth to Princess Elspeth and turned; and
 then she moved with Mum to Ireland.
 Molly explained how she'd come about: the donor who might be Mum's nephew
 at some remove, the stored egg, the hired surrogate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She told the story of how uncle Ilario and aunt Cath had adopted Petra and
 Julian at ages five and three, and what she knew of their odd, gradual
 approach to disclosing to their children that they were vampires.
 (Petra was disposed to likening the revelation to finding out that there
 was no Santa Claus: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nobody would tell me outright, they worried I'd tell our social worker,
 but a few people -- Aunt Gianna and Aunt Maggie, mostly -- went suspiciously
 quiet sometimes, and the evidence just accumulated.
 You wouldn't believe how silly I felt when I finally got up the nerve to
 ask Mum if she was a vampire, though, especially since I wasn't sure it
 was that as opposed to a dozen other things.

I was five months old, and Noemi took me out shopping for clothes because
 Dad can't go out in public at

So then,

 Corisande continued, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the Golden Coven did some damage control with the lady -- they keep the

The Masquerade, as it was called tongue-in-cheek, had been slowly deteriorating
 for most of Molly's life.
 The Golden Coven had inherited Volturi influence over major institutions
 worldwide, and were steadily reducing the degree to which this influence
 was based on deception.
 They were allowing unprecedented amounts of disclosure, albeit strictly
 through personal, one-to-one channels for immediate family and dearest
 friends of supernaturals.
 The turning rate had been permitted to rise sharply once a sufficient number
 of slaughterhouses were discreetly converted into blood-harvesting facilities
 that any vampire could visit for a fresh meal.
 Hybrids were born by the dozen annually, and their human relatives were
 allowed to know everything.
 Some entire 
\emph on
towns
\emph default
 were in the know -- the little beach town where Pleione, Corisande, and
 Joey lived contained plenty of informed humans.
 Forks,

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (which contained as much as 35% real truth).
  But this loon had to compete with all of the other loons, who were writing
 websites about mermaids or dragons or unicorns.
  The vampire website was interpreted as a project of deadpan epistolary
 fiction, or at worst the ravings of a sincerely delusional author.
  Official sources -- the ones that might be taken as something other than
 random loons -- were tied up with ancient baggage about the Volturi and
 could be leaned on.
  The temptation to make a great and efficacious attempt to be taken seriously,
 given the Golden Coven's technological and magical resources to track down
 anyone who crossed them, was kept to a minimum.

 inform their citizenry.
 Everyone would be told one at a time, by someone trustworthy who had the

 the missteps would be easily absorbed by the larger conspiracy.
 And someday this would just happen to achieve total information saturation,

 Mine will include sound, which you will hear in your native tongue even

 You each have a packet which includes a list of options and you're invited
 to check off any you'd like to see so we don't show them at random, but
 since you all need to be watching the same thing, you may not see all of
 the ones you select and will see some you didn't choose.

 Although you may or may not choose to eat immediately, you are advised

 The slaughterhouse operates at a steady rate twenty-four hours a day, and

One of the pregnant ones who had a vampire with her wanted to know if she

 Someone else -- who appeared to pose his question in Spanish, but Molly

By the time the hybrids were done jogging to the end of the hall, Molly

 Jasper sat at the other end of the plane, pouring calm into the air and

In 2035, a human Molly didn't know and didn't meet at a vampire-related
 event recognized her species for the first time.
 She was walking to her apartment from work (back-end web design, or rather
 10% back-end web design and 90% goofing off to hide her productivity speed
 from her boss), and a human man she'd never seen before stopped on the
 opposite sidewalk, looked her over, and then crossed the street.
  He left a margin of a few feet, but was clearly addressing her when he
 asked,

Pera's life was surprisingly little changed in its basic content.
 She moved around more, following the Golden Coven.

\begin_layout Standard
He worked irregular hours, going on quick missions for the Coven all over

 a break in the middle of one -- he came back to her.
 He brought her things -- shells from every beach on Earth, a diamond he'd
 stolen centuries previous and stashed in Antarctica, photographs of

 He sometimes reported the Coven's instructions to her, because this was
 generally preferable to hearing them from the Empress or whoever else might

 He only loved her, and she loved him back.

Kirsten was almost three whole years old.

\begin_layout Standard
Fast cold people came to the village, and so Kirsten's mommy left her with
 her daddy and turned furry (Mommy was soft when she was furry, but she
 didn't stay to let Kirsten snuggle in her deep coat this time) and ran
 off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy told Kirsten that the fast cold people were bad, and that Mommy was
 going to chase them off with the other wolves.
 He held her tight and wouldn't let her down off his lap to play blocks
 and run around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They waited a long time, and Kirsten fell asleep because she didn't have
 anything to do, and when she woke up a fast cold person was holding her
 with one arm and her daddy was also asleep and he had juice spilled on
 his neck even though he didn't spill stuff usually because he was grown
 up.
 Kirsten didn't think he was interesting anymore.
 And he didn't let her play blocks or run.

Kirsten's mommy came out of the woods.
 She had her fur on, black on top and white on her tummy and the front of
 her neck.

 the cold lady asked.
 Mommy nodded, and the lady said,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I taked a bath,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Kirsten.
 That meant she didn't smell at all.
 That was why people took baths, so they wouldn't smell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lady ignored her.
 She walked into the woods and Mommy went with them.
 They waited with a bunch of the other furry people and the cold people
 brought more kids from the village a few at a time.
 Kirsten curled up in her mommy's white tummy fur and went to sleep again
 and when she woke up, her mommy wasn't furry any more and was holding her
 in her lap on a plane.
 Kirsten knew it was a plane because she had a picture book about planes
 at home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bag of blocks was under the seat in front of them, but none of her books
 were.
 So Mommy had nothing to read to her.
 Kirsten looked out the window and watched clouds and towns and trees.
 They looked very small.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Kirsten was three, and she'd had her birthday in the middle of the air,
 which she thought was very funny.
 She lived in a new place.
 It was under the ground, and all the windows were in the ceiling.
 They were called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sky lights
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and Kirsten liked that name for them.
 There were three kinds of people in the place: wolves, like her mommy,
 and puppies, like Kirsten, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vampires
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the cold people.
 The cold people were in charge of the wolves and the wolves were in charge
 of the puppies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mommy specially was in charge of Kirsten.
 Most puppies didn't have somebody specially in charge for them -- just
 Kirsten who had Mommy, and Bar-tho-lo-mew who had Miz Vivian, and Lise
 and Sarah who had Mister Shawn, and Todd who had Miz Danielle 
\emph on

\emph default
 Mister Geoffrey.
 (
\emph on
Two

 Kirsten thought Todd must be very greedy.) Todd was 
\emph on
almost
\emph default
 Kirsten's age, but not quite, so he was a baby, and Lise and Bartholomew
 were even littler and Sarah was an

 Kirsten mostly didn't play with them.
 She played with the girls who were her age but lived in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

North
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section that meant they didn't have anyone specially in charge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes Mommy had to go on work trips to punish bad vampires.
 (The vampires who were in charge of the wolves were good police vampires
 and the wolves were helping.) When she did, Kirsten lived in North with
 her friends.
 Grownup wolves like Miz Eve (who was 
\emph on

\emph on

 Miz Eve was very good at not just saying

\begin_layout Standard
Miz Eve could not read her story books or play with her or answer

 This was because bad vampires hurt her so bad that she couldn't get better,
 even though wolves were really good at getting better.

\begin_layout Standard
Kirsten did not like bad vampires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once she asked her mommy if bad vampires might ever hurt

 but then she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and so Kirsten didn't, because Mommy was always right except about vegetables.
 Mommy was

 She thought they were for

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mister Albert was Miz Eve's brother.
 He was very sad about her being gone and cried all the time.
 Kirsten got her mommy get permission to take her Outside (it had a Capital
 Letter because going Outside was Important and Exciting and Un-Common)
 and when she was there, she picked a flower.
 She held it very carefully and brought it back into the village, and then
 she gave it to Albert, and he said thank you, and Kirsten felt very important.

Kirsten turned eight, and there were a lot of new people at her party.
 Not just new puppies or new imprints -- those were usual, they happened
 a lot -- but new 
\emph on
wolves
\emph default
 who were already grown up.
 (With new puppies and new imprints, too, including a girl and a boy who
 were 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

half-vampires".
 Mom said that the two of them together did not make an entire vampire,
 even though Kirsten was 
\emph on
sure
\emph default
 the fractions were right.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were interesting, but Mom told Kirsten not to stare and not to pester,
 so she didn't and just watched.
 They seemed nice.
 Elspeth was the half-vampire girl, and she had pretty bright shiny hair,
 and she visited the puppies sometimes and could make movies appear in Kirsten's
 brain -- not just regular movies with trailers at the beginning and credits
 at the end, but movies of anything at all.
 It was better than books.
 (Sometimes it 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 books, illustrated while Elspeth read them.
 Kirsten could read by herself, but it was more fun to let someone else
 do it.) Elspeth lived with Jacob who was an alpha like Becky and Rachel,
 even though he was a boy, because he was their brother.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The new imprints besides Elspeth weren't from Italy like most of the imprints
 that were already there, or even dark brown like Amanda, who was not Italian
 but from someplace called Canada.
 One of them was a blonde lady -- Kirsten didn't remember seeing any of
 those before except on

 She certainly didn't look like anyone else.

Mom eventually gave up on walking Kirsten through the process verbally,
 and the rest of the pack was too busy or distracted to do it, so Mom went
 in to her own room and padded out in the black-and-white shape that still
 towered over Kirsten's new form by several feet.
 Telepathy was

 catching that Mom or whoever else hadn't meant to share (and

 And she was not allowed to tell him (and he wouldn't believe her anyway,

 So she told him he smelled bad (he did, a little, but only because she

\begin_layout Standard
Until she was eighteen, she was entitled to be part of the Empire pack on

 Still, that was

It was just filing work.
 When the Coven was out of town, Nina kept the

 things less awkward.
 Todd, their son, had already signed on to the mobile branch of the Empire
 pack and didn't need to go anywhere, at least.
 Nina was overwhelmed with scanning and e-mailing and filing to do with
 Danielle gone, and the copier kept breaking and there was a difficult applicant
 in the lobby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Nina had gone into the back room of the

 do it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fifteen minutes later, she was sorting turning applications into alphabetical
 order by name and putting them in their correct folders while Nina dealt
 with the human and then fixed the copier.
 The next day, Kirsten showed up again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kirsten didn't have any strong feelings about filing.
 There wasn't anything else in particular she wanted to be doing for a career.
 Most days, she could get away with going to the office for an hour to give
 Nina a lunch break and another hour in the evening to help her catch up;
 she was only there from opening to close when there were a particular lot
 of things to do.
 She had no shortage of time to make her little matchstick models and watch
 every horrid thing on TV and play pickup soccer with the rest of the pack
 and go running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running on four legs was 
\emph on
amazing

 She was so

\emph default

 She came home when she was done with a run windblown, simultaneously hyper

 She made time every night without fail.
 Winifred came with her sometimes.
 Sometimes Mom did.
 Very occasionally someone else would feel like it.

Kirsten was twenty-two, and she was standing at her father's grave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The La Push wolves had made a vast memorial, rows upon rows of stones bearing
 the names of the dead.
 The graves weren't empty, but they did contain ashes mostly at random,
 as those didn't last in distinct heaps with the wind and rain over years.
 Kirsten could be standing over the buried cinders of a house or a curtain
 or a loaf of Wonder Bread.
 Most likely a house, some blackened plank of wood that had survived intact
 enough to be picked up and interred on his behalf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the name on the stone was her father's:

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Lost love

 Kirsten didn't know if it was meaningful to talk about two-year-olds loving
 people; she'd

\emph default
 two-year-olds and they mostly seemed messy and loud.
 She knew that 
\emph on
anyone

 forget them after a while.
 Adding Chelsea (well, Addy) on top of that was just overkill.
 But Kirsten couldn't help feeling injured anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her mom had made the trip a year ago, and didn't want to talk about it when
 she came back, which was understandable.
 Kirsten had gotten one very abrupt summary of the Coopers' marriage: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We were dating.
 I got pregnant.
 It was an accident, but I don't regret you, Kirsey.
 So, we got married.
 It was all right, I guess, but then he died.
 And...
 Chelsea.
 Any questions?

\begin_layout Standard
The Empress's brother (or something -- Kirsten wasn't actually sure how
 that worked), Emmett, had organized it.
 Wolves and hybrids and vampires were all going to congregate in the Forks/La
 Push area and compete in miscellaneous contests from swimming to gymnastics.
 They had to have separate divisions for a lot of things -- soccer had to
 be played with two feet, not four, because it was too easy for a claw to
 puncture a ball, and so the wolves couldn't play with the vampires but
 could play with some of the hybrids -- but there were a few that were mixed.
 Wolves could race with vampires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kirsten won the marathon, beating even lightning-quick Leah from the La
 Push contingent and a blurrily swift vampire from some tropical island,
 and got second in one of the shorter races, and her team won the wolf soccer
 tournament: she got three little circle-stamped pins, in yellow gold and
 white gold and rose gold.
 (Solo win, solo second, team win.) Then she sat in the stands and watched
 floor routines and ice skating and a ridiculous thing with a set of a 
\emph on
dozen
\emph default
 uneven bars instead of the usual two that went so fast she could barely
 follow it when the vampires went up.
 Santiago performed a dance that Kirsten dearly hoped someone was recording.
 Gwyn -- in Kirsten's pack, but the mobile branch -- had one nearly as lovely,
 as a pair with a hybrid boy Kirsten didn't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the attendees and participants hung around socializing after the

 Well, branches.
 There were enough wolves that there was rarely a reason to keep them together

 She stuck it out for a year, spending her time half in transit (usually
 artificial, not her own legs churning under her) and half on the ground
 pinning fleeing vampires.
 She was fast, and good at catching them, and didn't feel guilty about helping
 the way she might have if the Volturi had never been overthrown (this time

John waited, and closed his eyes.
 He could barely call Anne's face to mind.
 Turning into a human had loosened all the memories he'd gone in with, and

 He knew he'd had a daughter, he knew her name, but her face

John had to eat ten people in two hours or less to be able to visit his
 child up close for ten minutes without feeling like she was in danger from
 him, but that wasn't so hard.
 It was a little easier than eating just one or two, sometimes.
 It always felt 
\emph on
wasteful
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 kill anyone who spotted him while he was filling up.
 And it was better than before: when he'd been a newborn he hadn't dared
 try no matter how much he drank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anne seemed half made of pale hair, which was darkening a little as she
 grew.
 It tumbled over her neck and the arm she tucked under her head when she
 slept.
 He had to come in the night, because Anne spent her days in a crowded kitchen
 running spoons of leavening back and forth and stirring overstretched stews
 and scrubbing pans, and then he could only perch on the manor's roof and
 listen.
 She slept in a packed servant's quarters, but at least the other servants
 were asleep too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wasn't pleased about what had happened in his daughter's life, since
 his creator had turned him and killed his wife so Anne didn't have anyone
 to provide for her.
 He 
\emph on
wanted
\emph default
 to, but he didn't think England 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 that many humans in it, that he could safely keep Anne with him and not
 hurt her.
 And if he brought her coins, to leave in her shoes or under her pillow,
 everyone would think she'd stolen them, and she'd be turned out into the
 rain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So she worked in the manor kitchen for her turnips and her pallet, and John
 quietly picked off anyone who he overheard threatening her with a rolling
 pin.
 (The master's wife thought he must be getting the cooks pregnant and packing
 them off in secret with stipends, as three had vanished without explanation
 in the last year.)

Anne's breath wheezed out of her as she shifted in her sleep.

John, who'd been reaching his hand out to brush some of her fringe out of

\begin_layout Standard
She drew in a new breath, ragged and thready, but then she puffed it out
 normally and he relaxed.
 One odd breath, that was nothing...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a rasp, again, some rough edge to the way air was passing through
 her throat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He ground his teeth, but she was most likely fine.
 Perhaps she'd been one of the people he'd heard coughing that morning and
 she'd gotten herself a little hoarse.
 That was probably all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
John was gone before the servants woke, but through the whole day (his extravaga

 scale the wall under cover of ivy and listen) he worried about that soft
 wheeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the household settled down for the night, he stole in again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anne had evidently gotten up and done her work that morning -- her shoes
 were moved, she had a new cut on her hand from a knife too big for her
 to handle -- but working didn't seem to have been a good idea.
 She was pale and even with half her face hidden by hair she looked drawn,
 and thinner than she had the prior day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And she was wheezing with every breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
John waited another week before she got so sick that he was more afraid
 of 
\emph on
not

 gorged himself on half a hamlet until he felt like he'd pop, and carefully,

 Anne was the newest.

They had a web of rooms, underground beneath the palace the Volturi lived

Anne wasn't sure why they were allowed to live.
 She heard the grownup vampires talking about killing other immortal children,
 sometimes, but her and the other six were just left in the rooms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With supervision, always.
 Grownups took turns watching them, and by the time Anne had been there
 a week she'd learned how to put her fingers back on with spit and pressure
 (and learned not to try the same thing on Isaac, because she'd left scars
 on his wrists by accident and he'd screamed and kicked and been punished
 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 for that, and she was only trying to help).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By a month along, she was 
\emph on
much
\emph default
 better at being quiet even when she was angry, and she had stopped asking
 if maybe her father was alive somewhere, too, because the grownups didn't
 like it when she asked that.
 (Ermengarde still asked about her mothers.
 She wasn't as smart as Anne, and hadn't learned not to even though she'd
 been there for half her life and her mothers were obviously not going to
 come get her.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The grownups wanted her to learn other things too, but it was harder.
 She 
\emph on
remembered
\emph default
 everything they said, just fine.
 Word for word.
 But only when she was trying to remember those things, which was never
 when she was trying to tunnel out of the rooms for rage and cramped stir-crazin
ess.
 Never when she got so 
\emph on
mad
\emph default
 at Muhammad that she 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 to try to tear his throat out (even though it didn't work last time, or
 the time before that, because he had better reach than she did and was
 bigger).
 Never when she was just 
\emph on
bored
\emph default
, bored out of her 
\emph on
skull
\emph default
, because she wasn't allowed to go anywhere or do anything -- the grownups
 brought books sometimes but only when everyone had been well-behaved for
 a while because books were 
\emph on
expensive
\emph default
 and they didn't want the children wrecking them.
 So Anne took four years to have enough time with books that she could figure
 out how to read her first language.
 No one helped her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the grownups was called Aro, and he could read minds with a touch.
 He came in to the room sometimes, but only when everyone was -- rarely
 -- calm at the same time, and he'd stroke a finger across Anne's cheek
 and she had to fight herself not to try to bite through his hand (which
 would not work because of his attendant) nor fling herself away when he
 reached for her (since that would get her head wrenched off or her ribcage
 shattered for her insolence, because Aro was 
\emph on

 him).

 use words, don't shout, eat neatly

 fast enough when it counted, but she 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 remember that there was a missing child, and this kept her unsettled enough

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She read, or remembered what she'd read before.
 One of the grownups brought a set of dice and she gambled for pebbles with
 Muhammad, and sometimes Ermengarde (who cheated).
 She tried, futilely, to teach Lyyli more than her thousand-word vocabulary
 (which the little girl could translate into twelve languages, but seemed
 unable to otherwise expand, though Ermengarde could manage the trick with
 some difficulty).
 Anne picked up and cradled Joshua, who could move around but not that well
 and usually couldn't stop people from handling him, and she pretended she
 had grown up and had a baby.
 She curled up in a corner and wished she could sleep.
 Sometimes she thought about one of her vaporous human memories, the one
 which involved a church, and tried to reconstruct the practice of prayer
 in case it helped.
 (Muhammad did that occasionally too, but differently.) It didn't usually
 help.
 Anne thought it might be because she was a vampire, and vampires were not
 supposed to pray.
\end_layout

 He had gold eyes and pale hair, and didn't really look anything like Anne's

 He talked to Anne, a little.

Mike found out about vampires when the rest of Forks did -- which was a

He barely remembered Bella.
 She'd been in town a grand total of five months and he'd never even gotten
 around to asking her out.
 Apparently since then she'd turned into a vampire queen, not that Forks
 could advertise this and get more funding for the high school that'd had
 a hand in producing her.
 On the other hand, he did remember the rest of Bella's family (apart from
 the freakish daughter he'd seen all of once), and was less surprised than
 he should have been to find out what they were.

It was a while before actual vampires started showing up in Newton's Olympic
 Outfitters.
 They bought most of the same things human customers bought, except for
 much of the camping gear (they didn't eat -- except blood -- or sleep,

 If Mike was a little edgy around them, well, that didn't change the color
 of their money, and he served them like he would anyone else.
 His mother put in a custom order for Pyrex canteens, and those sold very
 well.
 Mike put up a

People talked in the store, about all topics under the sun.
 Mike overheard everything from the intimate details of eating disorders
 to surprisingly non-furtive confessions of adultery, which gossip was why
 Jessica still took him out to lunch on alternate Tuesdays even though she

 Still, Mike was surprised when he took out a box of jerseys to put on hangers
 only to hear a couple in the next aisle urgently discussing the pros and
 cons of becoming vampires.

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't the last time he heard something like that, either.
 Forks was one of a handful of cities in the world that could be reasonably
 called Vampire Central.
 This was good for the town's economy -- Bella and her crew bought local
 when it was convenient, and preferred suppliers in the know; Mike fielded
 huge orders for standard-issue Imperial Enforcer backpacks and lighters.
 But he didn't like it.

 But those loose vampire women Harry lived with never got knocked up, did
 they? (And why was she imagining that there would be anything of that nature

 More likely they would talk face-to-face and that would be the whole of

When it came down to it, nor did Sue like the idea of Rachel having to know
 about every moment she spent with her husband (no point in pretending he

 They worked out some logistics: she'd need to bring a change of clothes,

 to his

 Sue compared it to the way the wolves with imprints looked at those.
 It wasn't the same.
 It had that

 This when that slip of a girl was only seventeen and had never been and

 Sue helped herself to practical advice about diet, and when the interfering

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a strange pregnancy.
 She'd had the usual cravings with Seth and Leah, but never for blood, which
 tasted mysteriously delicious when Leah brought her the stuff from various

 When she wasn't sucking down as much blood as they could get her (and damned

She waited.
 Experimentally, she performed a backflip.
 It should have been exhilirating, but there was no dizzy urgency to the

 She didn't repeat the test; instead she looked around at the cabin.
 It was halfway decent; Harry had been busy while she was gestating with
 fixing the place up to be livable.
 There was no question of vampires living in the village itself.
 The house belonged to Leah now, and Seth.

Harry was back in no time (nine minutes, six and a half seconds) with Cody

 The little boy looked older than he should already -- slimmer than a human

So Sue was a prisoner, but they didn't have her restrained -- she shot a

 Whenever he spoke in answer, he had to pull in air to do it with, and whatever

Never,

 he murmured.

How could they? Supposedly, every one of them loves their mate as much as
 I love you.
 Are you imagining I could move on if something happened to you, that I
 could do anything short of go to the Volturi where my family might not
 dare intervene and beg them to help me follow you?

 But he didn't speak that thought.
 She was going to make the inference or ask the question herself: don't

 Bella said faintly.
 Her heartbeat was speeding up, and there was a distant dazed look on her

 He was sure she'd figured it out, nevertheless.

In the back of his mind, he prayed that if, one day, she had to be afraid

 Let her hate him for being a monster, fear him for wanting her blood, object

Edward produced a mental approximation of a snarl, forced back into the
 moment composed of pain and the absence of Bella.
 
\emph on
You have all my memories.
 You can rifle through them at your leisure.
 Why are you listening in on me while I replay them? You've made it clear
 I'm not likely to convince you to kill me, and I have no other use for
 your company.
 Why?

\begin_layout Standard

Bored,

Only so many times I can run through the same menu without getting that

 listening to you, anyway, don't be so self-centered; everybody's thinking

 Or, not so much happier, I suppose.
 Her mate's less disassembled than you lot are, at least.
 I'm not doing it to annoy you.
 You do tune me out mostly...

\begin_layout Standard

I can tune everyone out, until they think about Bella,

 Edward returned.
 
\emph on
You

\emph on
 why.

\emph default
 Through Addy's eyes he watched a quarter of his wrist twitch blindly towards
 another of the same and start gluing back together.
 They'd feed him in seven, maybe eight days, and then the pain would go
 away for an hour while Alec kept them docile.
 Then it would only be Bella's absence and Edward's helpless self-loathing
 about 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 they fed the captives plaguing him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy usually ignored the thoughts he didn't formulate as replies, and no
 differently on this occasion.
 
\emph on
So, I've been neglecting you for days now.
 Tell me: are you going in sequence from the time you met her, again, or
 skipping around -- highlights, best-of, greatest hits...?
\emph default
 inquired Addy.
 
\emph on
Marathon of every time she smiled at you, back-to-back with no commercial
 breaks? Do I get to make a request? Freebird!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Skipping around,
\emph default
 he answered.
 Talking to Addy wasn't entirely voluntary, done this way.
 She'd hear whatever he thought whether he decided to answer her or not,
 and unlike his family he'd never developed the skill of refusing to think
 of something.
 
\emph on
Nothing systematic.
 And no requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Aw, I was only joking about Freebird, I know you're all about art music,

Or relive your honeymoon again.
 You can't be bored of it already; you've only run through it, what...

Ninety-four times
\emph default
 Edward answered unwillingly.
 It was twelve days of concentrated, unadulterated Bella.
 Twelve days untroubled with the politics and travel and family squabbles
 and similar interruptions to what should have been an easy, happy life.
 (Until that damned phone rang.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If he walked through that indelible memory, or any other, in real time,
 and concentrated very, very hard, he could forget the physical pain (which
 was never as bad as turning, anyway).
 He could almost forget, too, that the woman he remembered was dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Or your daughter,
\emph default
 suggested Addy.
 
\emph on
You never think about her except in terms of Bella.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Why would I?
\emph default
 he thought.
 
\emph on
You took her from me.
 I'm not even clear on why.
 Didn't want to round out a hat trick of torture making me miss her too?
 Uncharacteristic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Just thoroughness.
 That's hardly uncharacteristic.
 Your feelings on the matter were irrelevant, I'm sure you recall.
 Oh -- I don't remember if anyone even notified you when we learned some
 news,
\emph default
 Addy thought lightly.
 
\emph on
Elspeth's been missing from home for years now.
 Eleazar called us on his cousins' behalf, asking if we'd heard anything,
 but we didn't know where she'd gotten to either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I don't care,

 Edward said.

Edward couldn't see, his ears were fractionated into uselessness, and his
 nerves were reporting only confusion and pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he could hear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No doubt his brain was in -- no, he didn't have to guess, one of the wolves
 was looking right at him.
 Brain in nine pieces.
 But somehow it functioned.
 And he could listen through others' senses and know what was going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other wolves were looking at Bella, also -- he wanted to scream, but that
 was impossible -- also scattered.
 Their pieces were mingled together, bending and quivering.
 Bella's mind was silent as ever and Edward didn't know if he was glad of
 it or not.
 If he'd been able to hear her, he would have been with her -- in some small
 way -- at that moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If he'd been able to hear her, he would have been listening to her scream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was hard to keep hold of the present moment, taken apart, but he kept
 time by the thoughts of others.
 Wolves, thinking in twin choruses linked by the alphas, thoughts sterilized
 with Chelsea's cauterizing cuts.
 Fewer than there would have been: the wolf called Jacob who'd called Bella
 was away safely with some others.
 Vampires: Jane and Alec.
 Afton and Chelsea.
 Demetri.
 Aro and Renata.
 
\emph on
Addy
\emph default
, the new element in the coven, the one he'd misunderstood until too late.
 The reason they didn't want to kill him but had no qualms about killing
 Bella.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry and Sue, the couple Bella had helped, were already dead; Edward couldn't
 hear them, but he could see their ashes and pick up the knowledge of who
 they were from the wolves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Addy drew closer, to sort out the pieces of him and his mate, and
 Edward heard: anticipation, and hunger.
 She might want to keep Bella alive too.
 She might have enough pull to manage it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy laid a hand on part of Bella's arm, and then when it repelled her gift,
 she hissed furiously and hurled the piece against a tree.
 The sharp edge of it lodged in the wood, where it quivered.

I can, if it's so disagreeable to you,

 said Aro lightly, every inch the monarch condescending to assist a subject,
 and Addy played her part too, but there was a flare of something else --
 blackmail? That didn't make sense -- Edward couldn't read it deeper than
 that, as it wasn't on the surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aro couldn't affect Bella any more than Addy could, but his failures were
 not uncomfortable; he separated the parts of each, telling them apart by
 whether he could read thoughts from them or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Not Bella!
\emph default
 howled Edward as loudly as he could with no intact mouth.
 
\emph on
Don't kill her,

Aro ignored him.

The two vampires were sorted out in minutes, collected in boxes.

Dispose of her, please, she'll be of no use and has demonstrated that she

 He handed the box that contained Edward to her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward focused tightly on Afton, wishing he could do anything else but watch
 his wife die.
 But he couldn't close out the stream of input, and Bella compelled his
 attention even at the end.
 He ignored Addy's glee over his flavor (root beer), ignored what Aro said
 to his minions and the wolves, and just -- heard

\begin_layout Standard
Afton poured Bella into the pit they'd made to protect the wolves from smoke.
 He struck the last match out of his box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he tossed it in after her, and leaned in to make sure she'd caught,
 and Edward despaired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was Elspeth, still -- Carlisle and Esme and Rosalie and Emmett had
 Elspeth, safe, she was safe, she had Bella's eyes

\begin_layout Standard
Afton wasn't watching Bella burn anymore.
 Once he reported to Aro that her death was underway, no one gave her a
 second thought.
 A pocket of rage burst open in Edward's mind, but soon burned itself out
 and was replaced by despair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy thought, quite deliberately: 
\emph on
Hi! I'm Addy.
 I'll be profiting from your imprisonment.
 Yum.
 Ooh! Forgot to Chelsea you.
 Not likely to be important, but...

Chelsea nodded fervently, touched Addy's hand, and then went back to her
 ongoing work with the wolves, cutting and pulling and weaving.

\emph on
No, not my daughter, no, leave me something, just something!

Addy hovered a hand over the box, and waved it left to right.
 Edward felt the threads tear like paper against her skin, all in series:

Edward scrabbled mentally for the lost connections, more out of duty than
 emotion, but whenever he recovered a wisp of one, Addy waved her hand again
 and it was gone.

Eventually he stopped trying and his thoughts went back to making circles

Edward did his best not to reply that he'd visited the memory specifically
 to remind himself that he hated Addy and shouldn't be chatting civilly
 with her.
 At least he tried to avoid thinking of it on a high enough level that she'd
 hear.
