\begin_layout Chapter
Brother
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked at Pera.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You unhid him?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded, sleepily.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He came through the door between our rooms, and woke me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she yawned, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

said it was important, I unhid him and went back to sleep.
 I didn't think about it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I tried to think if Cody had put any special effort into getting the spot
 adjacent to Brady and Pera's room.
 I couldn't remember; it hadn't been worth paying attention to at the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He didn't come to let me know I could go to sleep at his usual time.
 When I went to check on him, his window was open and he was gone.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did he...
 leave a note?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, although if he had, they probably wouldn't have been this alarmed.
 Depending on what the note said, anyway.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Sam.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why did you wake me up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, rubbing my eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To make sure you were still here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Jacob.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pera said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was half-asleep.
 I might have forgotten, if he had asked me to unhide someone else too.
 Jacob wanted to check.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shook my head.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He didn't even wake me.
 Where would he go?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No idea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Sam.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are we going to try tracking him...?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can't, while we're hidden and he's not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sam said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's the other reason we woke you up.
 Our noses aren't good enough for serious tracking when we're not wolves,
 and we're in the middle of town so we can't exactly track Cody that way,
 but you look human.
 If Pera unhides 
\emph on
you
\emph default
, you could see if you can follow him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O-okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but I'm not very good at tracking.
 I've never really done it before.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's all right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jacob said, soothingly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But if you're willing, it's worth a try.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded.
 Jacob offered to go with me, but I said I could do it myself; I didn't
 really feel up to a long awkward walk through town with him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I followed Sam to the room Cody had been using.
 There were a lot of scents, layered on top of each other -- I was pretty
 sure it was a smoking room, for one thing -- but Cody's, left before Pera
 had unhidden him, was the one that smelled most like my own, with a layer
 of sweet venom like Mama's breath on top.
 I leaned out the window.
 There was a small courtyard he could have easily jumped down to, and a
 whole town he could have wandered through to cross his trail with every
 human's.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, turning to find that Pera and Jacob had followed, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unhide me and I'll see what I can find.
 I'll come back when I lose it, or if I find him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pera touched me on the shoulder, and she and both wolves disappeared.
 I gulped, and hopped out the window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was able to follow the trail farther than I would have guessed.
 It meandered through town, and fizzled out in a parking lot at the opposite
 edge of town.
 Losing it there, I turned around to go back and report on my findings,
 but then I smelled wolf.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't know how to tell who it was, but I'd been with Jacob's pack all
 along, so it couldn't have been any of them.
 Even if someone had followed me, I shouldn't have smelled him while he
 was hidden.
 That meant a kept wolf had been nearby.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gingerly, I followed 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 trail.
 It led from the parking lot down the block.
 There was a spot of sidewalk where the scent was thicker, like the person
 who left it had stood there for a few minutes before moving on, but it
 was a nondescript place.
 Just a square of concrete between a Starbucks and a trash can.
 And it wouldn't take a few minutes to throw something out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I peered into the trash can anyway.
 There was a yellow legal pad there, sitting on top of the usual detritus.
 It was upside-down, but on the cardboard backing, I could see written in
 black marker, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\noun on
Hey Cody please hear us out
\noun default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I picked up the pad, and read.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first page also said, in the same marker, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\noun on
Hey Cody please hear us out
\noun default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I turned to the next one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were three sets of handwriting.
 The one that most resembled the capital letters started off.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just me (I'm Seth!) and Leah, Cody.
 We just want to talk to you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neater, more angular writing followed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You never sent me any messages through the alphas.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I guessed that was Cody.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rachel wouldn't pass anything along,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said someone with loopier penmanship, probably Leah.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We only just got permission to try to contact you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (This sentence was circled.) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But we missed you the whole time, Cody-kiddo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody wrote, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chelsea wouldn't let you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seth: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes she would.
 She's not a monster.
 I mean, she's a vampire, but not a 
\emph on
monster-
\emph default
monster.
 She's actually pretty nice.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leah: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know what kinds of stories Jake and company have been telling you
 about Chelsea, but let me tell you one.
 I don't think I would have ever gotten over Sam without her help, and I
 say `help' advisedly.
 I didn't technically 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 to be over Sam just to join up with the Volturi.
 I 
\bar under
asked
\bar default
 her to help me, and she did, and I feel 
\bar under
better
\bar default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The medium didn't give me any impression of time passing, but Seth's writing
 next said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cody? Are you there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody wrote, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seth: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You aren't going to wake everybody up and have them attack us, are you?
 We're really here alone.
 Demetri pointed the way, but he's not here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There were more than two wolves last night when we were out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leah: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Those were some of Becky's, not us, and they weren't even here for you,
 they were here about a coven in Omaha with a different guard.
 Us and Demetri just got here.
 It's a coincidence that Becky's bunch ran into your group.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What do you want?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seth: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We want to bring you with us.
 You're family.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why 
\bar under
now
\bar default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I guessed that this might have been when the sentence above was circled.
 And then, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But why did you get permission now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leah: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vampires take a while to get impatient, but Jake's pack is starting to annoy
 them.
 They're going to get creative.
 I asked Chelsea to appeal to the higher-ups for me and she did, and we
 were allowed to come try to get you out first.
 You're a free agent, no imprint, no alpha voice in your head.
 You were only a baby when they took you, Cody-kiddo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If Jake hadn't taken me, the Volturi would have killed me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Seth wrote.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They wouldn't have.
 You're not a human, and you didn't attack them, so they wouldn't have hurt
 you any more than they hurt the pups that came with us back then.
 Oh, `pups' are the kids who can't activate yet.
 But some of them have gotten old enough since.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't want to help the Volturi.
 Not to hurt Jake's pack or do anything else.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leah: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's fine.
 We won't even ask you to touch Aro -- you don't have to tell us anything
 you don't want to.
 We just want you out of the way before things get iffy.
 Out of the way as in 
\bar under
not involved
\bar default
, not as in 
\bar under
on our side
\bar default
.
 Will you come with us? Please say yes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seth: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And hurry.
 Someone might wake up and see you writing this.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need time to think.
 And someone may be up soon.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leah: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When should we come back?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're going east.
 We'll probably stop in a town.
 Get Demetri to tell you which town and wait in front of a Starbucks, there's
 bound to be one.
 I'll find you if I want to go with you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leah: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay, Cody-kiddo.
 We love you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seth: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Me too!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was the last line of writing.
 Clutching the yellow legal pad, I jogged back to the hotel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone was awake -- although they mostly looked unhappy about it -- by
 the time I got back to the hotel.
 Pera re-hid me as soon as I got to the correct hallway, and I handed over
 the yellow legal pad to Jacob, averting my eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I found it in a garbage can,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Outside a Starbucks.
 Cody's trail went cold in a parking lot nearby, and then I smelled a wolf
 and followed that there.
 I think they were standing around for a while.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jacob read it, and the others crowded around him, trying to get a look at
 it too.
 I held out my hands: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can show two people who don't want to wait,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I offered.
 Kim and Jared stepped forward and I showed them the memory of what I'd
 read.
 Meanwhile, Jacob's expression grew steadily darker, and some of the color
 left his face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When everyone knew the contents of the written conversation, there was a
 short silence, and then everyone was talking at once.
 I made out Pera's stammered apology, Darren's demand to know how the kept
 wolves could have known when to catch Cody alone, Kim's sob about the abandonme
nt, Emily's wispy murmur of fear, and Zachary's confusion about why the
 legal pad had been so easy to find.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hush,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jacob, and there was a little steel in his voice -- just barely enough.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

One at at time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Everyone quieted, and he turned to Pera first.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera.
 This isn't your fault.
 On any other day, if Cody had suddenly wanted to be unhidden, it would
 have been for a good reason.
 You don't need to be our gatekeeper.
 Please don't beat yourself up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She pursed her lips unhappily and turned towards Brady, who willingly gathered
 her up in his arms to comfort her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that Jacob went around the circle of people in an orderly manner,
 asking them to repeat their questions and comments as necessary.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Darren, remember that they 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 spend some time with Cody when he was very young; they'd know his sleeping
 patterns and might have just gambled on them remaining the same.
 Kim, I don't think Cody wanted to hurt you or any of us.
 It's...
 natural that he'd miss his brother and sister, and would want to go to
 them if they could offer any plausible way he could do it safely.
 Emily, I don't think we're in particular danger from Cody's absence.
 They can already find us wherever we go.
 They're already neck-deep in witches.
 The risks are what `creative' ideas they're impatient enough to try, and
 this way we at least have some warning.
 Zach, my guess is that they had the pad on them while they waited outside
 the coffeeshop in case Cody arrived hidden and wanted to write to them.
 When he showed up unhidden, they tossed it.
 It was careless, but this is definitely Cody's handwriting; even if they
 faked it somehow, they had his help.
 I think we can safely assume that it's what it looks like.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He quelled more nervousness, professed ignorance on a few more details.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he turned to me, gazing steadily into my eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're welcome,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured, avoiding the temptation to flinch away from his too-enraptured,
 too-focused face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quil, who had been whispering translations of the events in simpler language
 for Claire's benefit, asked, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's next, Jake?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jacob began, but I must have twitched, because his attention flicked right
 back to me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it, Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cody knows Mama is alive,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I whispered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cody knows where she'll wait for me.
 I don't believe that they won't read his mind.
 Even if Aro really doesn't do it, Del could copy Aro and do it for him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jacob stared at me, his face full of horror.
 And then a grim determination settled over his features, and he turned
 back to Quil to answer his question.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're continuing to New York,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As fast as we can go.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tried to protest that the entire pack didn't have to cater to my needs,
 and that I could go by myself to find and warn Mama.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't very good at it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few people seemed willing to take me at my unbelievable word, and let
 me go to the city alone while the pack made its own defensive maneuvers.
 But Jacob wouldn't hear of it.
 It was 
\emph on
obvious
\emph default
 that what I really wanted was company, and a chance of getting to Mama
 first or fighting off anyone who wanted to hurt her.
 And as long as that was obvious, and Jacob had the power to see that I
 wasn't alone and defenseless, he would do it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mama probably isn't even 
\emph on
in
\emph default
 New York yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She'll be at least a couple more days.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then we can beat her there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jacob said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if we hop a plane.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took a few hours of running to get to the nearest airport.
 I was rather worried that such a large group of people sneaking onto an
 aircraft might cause issues of weight tolerance, but they'd apparently
 managed the feat before without crashing.
 We went around the apparently-deserted security stations, not wanting to
 set off any of their devices, and found a flight bound for LaGuardia.
 We wove around eerily self-propelling suitcases and levitating bags, but
 once we were on the plane we could sit in whatever seats we wanted as long
 as we sat forward of the seatbelts.
 Mostly we accumulated in first class, although Claire preferred to clamber
 around on the seats in coach (probably alarming anybody who noticed the
 way she'd jostle everything she touched, but on an airplane there was always
 another passenger or turbulence to attribute the motion to.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I borrowed Ruth, as an alternative to sitting alone.
 Maureen yielded her readily, and I showed the toddler storybooks and scenery
 and music and whatever else she asked for.
 Ruth was two years old, and simple and easy to please, and she didn't stare

Much as one can, yeah.
 Noticed there had been a couple of Makahs, thought their rez would be a

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, I suppose it's not really a

 I am -- or was, it's confusing -- gay.
 Nothing wrong with that, or so some sources'll tell you, but...
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He shrugged.

It

was

 hard.
 I'd been in the closet but once I activated and there was telepathy flying
 all over the place, I couldn't be, not in the pack.
 Nobody gave me a hard time about it, exactly, Rachel wouldn't have it,
 but I never got to choose whether to tell them, and I figured it was only
 a matter of time before somebody let it slip to my parents, who -- great
 folks.
 They were great folks.
 But they'd have taken it hard.
 And I figured, well, if 
\emph on
anything
\emph default
 will fix it, imprinting's supposedly to make sure the werewolf gene gets
 passed down, that kinda limits the pool, and I could tell how strong it
 was for the ones who'd found their girls already.

 He closed his eyes, remembering, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It was like everything that tied me to the world, all my relationships and
 cares and worries, released me, and instead there was Maureen, my one anchor.
 A stronger anchor than all the old ties put together.
 The heart of the world, that everything else revolved around.
 It was the most beautiful experience of my life.
 The symmetry of everything is clear when you see what's in the middle of
 it all.

Worrying about Jake? Well, here's what would've happened.
 I would have gone home.
 Would have been prepared to wait for her, forever, in case she ever changed
 her mind.
 Would have thought of her always, wished for her always.
 But...
 it wouldn't've killed me, and I could've built the rest of my life back
 up again.
 And I would never have wanted her to feel like she had to do anything she

The plane landed, and we followed the last few rolling suitcases onto the

I talked to Jacob, a little, while we waited.
 We didn't directly address the fact of his imprinting.

Pretty much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

It was before Mama got her job, so it would have been too expensive to stay
 in a hotel.
 That meant we couldn't stay overnight; you can't really camp out in a city
 unless you're hidden like this.
 Also Mama is pretty sure there are vampires around here, although we didn't
 meet any.
 Big cities are likely to have them because there are so many people that
 a few can go missing without attracting attention.

If they were anyone Mama knew, they'd find out she was alive, and it could

 I paused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Or both.
 We never go to Tennessee because my uncle Jasper lives there, and when
 Mama ran into him -- before she found me when I was six months old -- he
 had gone crazy.
 He attacked her.
 She only escaped because he was too crazy to fight seriously, and she managed
 to convince him that she was somebody else and he was hallucinating.

I think the phrasing Kim used that we all picked up was that they hadn't

 I couldn't sort out how I felt about him anymore.
 Maybe I could have understood it if I'd had any brothers or sisters, or
 if I'd been raised by my relatives and not Mama for my whole life.
 Was it only that, that he missed Leah and Seth? Was that why it had taken
 so little, such unenforceable assurances, before he would skip off and
 leave no note behind?

 The parents would have relatives they wouldn't want to cut off, too, who
 would in turn have relatives, and the pack needed mobility that depended
 on its wolf-to-human ratio.
 If they couldn't run away, fast, when a Volturi guard set their campsite
