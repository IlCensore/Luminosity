I've got a job now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Nathan, laughing.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's an improvement over sitting around waiting for you to call and say
 `jump', I s'pose.
 What's my job exactly? I hope you're not going to ask me to just knock
 on the castle door.
 Remember what I said about how my power will go right ahead and tell me
 the best time to set myself on fire but
\begin_inset space ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But if you do something fatal at the best time it will probably still be
 fatal, I understand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, knocking isn't part of the plan.
 What we're going to do is send you, Elspeth, and Allirea into the wolf
 village.
 Allirea will stick close to you and keep you faded, and your job will be
 to prevent wolves from sounding the alarm or trapping Elspeth before she's
 deprogrammed everyone there.
 Since Allirea will be faded herself, you won't be able to pay attention
 to her, but apparently you're used to doing things without knowing exactly
 why you're doing them 
\emph on
anyway
\emph default
, which seems likely to help you follow through on a plan that calls for
 you to coordinate with her.
 As far as you'll be concerned, you're Elspeth's bodyguard who everybody,
 including Elspeth, will mysteriously overlook.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All right...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Nathan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't hurt the wolves if you can avoid it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan went on.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 don't hurt the imprints, or the kids.
 You shouldn't need to, for one thing.
 You'll have every advantage in the world to tie them up if they won't hold
 still voluntarily -- we'll send you in with a mess of rope or equivalent.
 That won't hold a determined wolf but it could give Elspeth the time she
 needs.
 The imprints are harmless but after everything settles down you 
\emph on
don't
\emph default
 want to have hurt one.
 The puppies are harmless too unless one chooses this day to activate, in
 which case it's just another wolf to deal with.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And then what?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then, you -- and Allirea will follow you, but you won't know it -- go into
 the compound via the entrance.
 You will choose optimal times to knock out Volturi you come across.
 You're not going to be able to attack Renata or the people she has directly
 covered, and you'll only catch Heidi with her power off if she's behaving
 abnormally today, but everybody else, take 'em apart.
 Don't set anyone on fire.
 Just break them.
 We'll sort out later who lives, who dies, and who gets to serve a sentence
 in the hiding place if Pera helps, after the fact.
 Breaking them will be enough for the rest of us to pour in and take care
 of Renata's charges and Heidi -- or for Bella to do that, rather.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And you lot will know when to pour in how?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Nathan asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do I go in wearing a wire, maybe, and give word at the right time? I suppose
 you won't pay attention to me until Allirea lets up on her trick -- I'll
 have some keyword or something to tell her when and know when to say 
\emph on
that
\emph default
, maybe, and then she can back off and I can talk to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That works,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan agreed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

One question regarding your power -- and you might not know, we might have
 to have Eleazar look at you -- but: best timing for 
\emph on
whom
\emph default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Me, presumably,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Nathan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't have a history of working in groups.
 Don't know how much it'll cover the rest of you.
 Is it a worry that I'll move around too fast for Allirea to follow?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, I think if your power can handle Allirea at all, it'll keep you at an
 acceptable speed,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not protecting her -- she's protecting you.
 I'm more concerned that you'll find the 
\emph on
best time
\emph default
 to do something completely unhelpful, like volunteer to join the guard
 or run off by yourself.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Nathan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I did know when to call you and give you the info, didn't I? So one way
 or another the power knows I'm working with you.
 I'm not sure what else you want me to do to prove I'm on your side.
 I guess you could bribe me with goodies for after we win or something...
 in fact, feel free...
 but I'm all for a win for Team Us.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fair enough,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I still want to show you to Eleazar and find out what he makes of you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fine by me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Nathan said affably.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, can you tell me what's going to happen after we win, by any chance?
 What kinds of goodies might I get bribed with? Do we all get to vote for
 president?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Current working plan is that Bella becomes queen of the world,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Other configurations are also possible; we're not sure yet.
 Anyway.
 We'll be in London day after tomorrow, Nathan, and then we can inspect
 and experiment with your good timing.
 In the meantime, this would be a good time to

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 There was a click as he hung up, and Siobhan said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I could have seen that coming.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm going to hang up now too,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, and she did.
 She gave me a significant look, and I also closed my phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It just occurred to me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said in a low voice, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that anyone who doesn't want me to be in charge after the rebellion, such
 as anyone who wants to go on eating humans with impunity, 
\emph on
has a strong incentive to see that Edward doesn't live through this.
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or just you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm a more challenging target,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, starting to pace and throwing Allirea a suspicious look.
 Allirea's black eyes looked back calmly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm ambulatory, I'm shielded from several types of attack, and it requires
 significantly more attention to get me killed than it would to kill most
 people.
 Edward is still in bits in that dungeon, as vulnerable as it is possible
 for a vampire to be.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Yeah, he is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, not at all sure why she was telling me this.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there something you want me to do about that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Renata would have gone with Aro and Chelsea to Nicaragua, wouldn't she?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She wasn't blasted.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I point that out to Siobhan, and you volunteer to help, she might send
 you in to knock out Renata once Nathan and Allirea have done everything
 they can, instead of having you hang back in the village,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Everybody on our side -- that is, everybody who might have the information
 that I'm in the running for Queen and that this would most likely mean
 murder becoming illegal for vampires -- 
\emph on
hasn't
\emph default
 been blasted yet except for Siobhan herself.
 That means that if you get into the compound when most of the guard is
 broken, and knock out Renata, you can also protect your father from anyone
 who might choose that time to harm him.
 David's there too, but I don't think anyone has an incentive to hurt him
 except insofar as it might be hard to tell him and Edward apart in their
 current state.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But Siobhan eats people herself,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and is blasted so I can't stop her from doing anything if she decides to
 do it.
 And Allirea could walk right by me.
 And Addy could show up and I can't blast her either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm trusting Allirea on this one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, although the wary look on her face suggested that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trust
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was a strong word.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think she's sufficiently cognizant of the fact that she can't fade from
 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 that she wouldn't involve herself in harming my mate.
 Also, I'm not sure if you've noticed, but since she knows I won't put up
 with her killing humans she's not even bothering to hunt for sheep or anything
 else available around here.
 She's just eating normal food.
 I don't think she's that attached to the pseudo-legality of murder.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She was talking like Allirea wasn't there, which after a moment's thought
 I decided could just as easily be deference to Allirea's own preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about Siobhan and Addy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Siobhan had every chance to make a bid for world domination or to come up
 with a better idea than me ruling the world,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't rule out the possibility that she's concocting something behind
 my back, but since I don't currently have the resources to oppose her if
 she decided she wanted to take command, and she ought to know I know that,
 she'd probably have said something.
 She might be angling for some kind of dispensation.
 I might even have to give it to her.
 But I don't 
\emph on
think
\emph default
 she'd kill Edward even if she didn't want me to be queen; she has other
 avenues open.
 Anyway, if she tries it, there's common knowledge of the fact that you
 can't stop her.
 You wouldn't need to try to get in her way.
 As for Addy...
 I have no idea what she's doing, but I'd expect her to have a little extra
 trouble getting into the compound during or after the fight.
 She'd have to convince quite a few people to help her out before she got
 as far as the dungeon.
 I'm not counting on that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy could already be there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not in the compound,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice would have noticed either Addy or a blank spot.
 She'd hide better in the village, but if she's 
\emph on
there
\emph default
, Nathan will be able to kill her on your group's way in -- she'd take his
 power, but that'd just evenly match them without third party interference,
 and he'll have Allirea's help.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Should I tell Siobhan about this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

since you don't think she'd be the one to worry about anyway and it's probably
 not a good idea to surprise her? I don't mean on the phone where anybody
 could overhear, I mean...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I tapped my temple with one finger.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Privately.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother thought for a minute, then nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When you have a reason to be within range of her anyway.
 Don't make a separate trip for it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was a little concerned that I'd have to convince you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother admitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't want murder to be legal any more than you do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I pointed out.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And if something happened to Dad you wouldn't be able to rule the world,
 and I don't think any other vegetarians are ambitious enough to try it.
 I can't do it.
 I'm five, so I don't think vampires in general would take me very seriously
 even if I were otherwise all set to go.
 And my major defense mechanism only works once per person, and we still
 don't know how well the coma holds up versus lethal force.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, biting her lip a bit and turning away.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To be fair, I'm twenty-three and I'm not sure if that's old enough to be
 taken seriously by the crowd we're talking about here, either.
 I hope Pera decides to help us...
 even if only after the fact and not during.
 What can you tell me about her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's very...
 skittish, I guess you could say,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm afraid she's really going to resent you for trying to eat her.
 But she forgave everybody in Jake's old pack for how things were before
 he stepped up to the leadership role...
 or at least I think she did.
 She interacted civilly with them and hid and unhid them on demand, anyway.
 I might get some leverage for having done the blank sending painkiller
 thing while she turned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I conjectured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Although it might only be enough to compensate for the fact that I told
 her it was safe to unhide you...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I should have held my breath,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother muttered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shouldn't have inhaled.
 Had no particular reason to inhale.
 It's a 
\emph on
habit
\emph default
 and I did it anyway, I didn't even think of the possibility of a singer...
 at least she's turned now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She probably can't remember that very clearly, at least,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I volunteered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Probably.
 But she still knows it happened.
 You saw me pull back, right? You can tell her I did? I don't think I would
 have actually eaten her even if it hadn't been for you and the wolves.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can tell her you did, sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 I tilted my head and looked at my slumbering wolf.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wonder if she still looks at Jake as an authority figure.
 He bossed around a pack with her in it for five years.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does Chelsea cut that kind of thing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Only sort of.
 If she were obeying Jake because she liked him or even just respected him
 as a person, Chelsea would have gotten rid of that, definitely.
 If she were obeying him because he's an alpha, then no -- but probably
 she's not identifying herself as a pack member anymore.
 Anything left would be just leftover habits, that she could break if there
 were cause.

Safe guess,

 It read,

I scooped up Jacob carefully, and, stepping gently so as not to wake him,
 trotted across the mountains and down to the houses.
 I didn't see or hear anyone, so I wandered around, calling, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Pera? Pera?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the assumption that she'd hide me soon enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a few seconds, all of the vampires who'd congregated in the Denali
 houses flared into existence around me, Pera closest with one hand on my
 shoulder and the other on Jake's forehead.
 She danced back a couple of steps when we were both in the hiding place,
 making a strange huffing sound that was presumably her attempt to clear
 her nostrils of Jake's wolf smell.
 Razi, who looked every inch the protective mate, popped into place beside
 her and clasped her hand in his.

All set?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Siobhan asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want to drive Jake to the airport instead of running, Elspeth? That'd
 probably be faster than you carrying him, although you'd need to be unhidden
 to avoid an apparently driverless vehicle careening down the highway and
 getting unwanted attention.

I took my wolf to the Denalis' garage, found the blue car, and got him to
 wake up enough that he could sit up in the passenger seat, let me buckle
 him in, and flop against the door to drop back off to sleep.
 The wound on his neck looked no worse than a scrape by this point, but
 he was likely to be pretty groggy until we reached Europe.
 I slid in behind the wheel, mentally poked Memory, and pulled out of the
 garage.

I couldn't tell, but I assumed the vampires were close on my tail as I got
 onto the highway and headed for the airport.
 I tried to avoid speeding overmuch.
 I didn't have a license on me, and rather suspected that Pera would hide
 and eat (or allow someone else to eat) any cop who pulled me over, instead
 of letting the situation unfold more conventionally.

I got all the way to the parking lot without police attention, and a moment
 after I cut the engine, my door and then Jake's opened as though by the
 intervention of poltergeists, and we were hidden again.
 I picked Jake up, locked the car in case Tanya wanted it again later, and
 followed the nearly two dozen vampires to the airplane.

 Siobhan asked Pera, once we were all on the flight, scattered throughout

 I sat Jake in a window seat; he woke up long enough to mumble a complaint
 about legroom and then close his eyes again.

No,

I didn't hit on anything particularly germane, mostly just amusing myself

 speed on the guard we were about to attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It occurred to me that we'd talked about Renata mostly as a obstacle, rather
 than as a person, so I looked at what I had of her, but on inspection our
 prior inattention was justified: she was just staggeringly boring.
 I'd done more noteworthy deeds in the past two months than she had in the
 past millennium.
 She'd been scooped up by the Volturi thirty-six years after being turned
 by an unremarkable vampire, who she'd followed around hunting and scrabbling
 for territory and then abandoned without a second thought when offered
 the prestigious position of Aro's bodyguard.
 She had astoundingly little going on in her head for a vampire -- she gave
 herself over to her senses more fully than most, swimming in sights and
 sounds and smells and textures and, when applicable, the flavor of blood,
 rather than pursuing anything more complicated.
 It would have been dangerous for any other vampire.
 It was a pretty newborn-like mindset, usually compensated for in actual
 newborns by the extra strength.
 When the strength wore off, the mentality was dangerous.
 But it wasn't dangerous for 
\emph on
her
\emph default
, because all the dangers it could have exposed her to were flawlessly turned
 away by her witchcraft.
 (Jane and the like could still hurt Renata, but joining the Volturi had
 rid her of that hazard except for early moments when Aro wanted

testing
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 done.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought about Sulpicia and Athenodora, the living Volturi wives.
 They were somewhat more interesting than Renata -- they had hobbies, at
 least, they read books and talked and painted and played instruments and
 had recently ventured onto the Internet.
 But they were very solitary creatures except for their respective husbands
 and each other and Chelsea, the latter having insinuated herself into their
 small social circle regardless of whether she would have found natural
 welcome there.
 Athenodora and Sulpicia were considered serious vulnerabilities (justifiably
 so) and as such did not leave the tower to venture into a world full of
 people who didn't care for their mates.
 Caius didn't depart often, either, but Aro often found himself necessary
 on various field assignments due to his power.

\begin_layout Standard
I killed a good hour and a half just 
\emph on
looking
\emph default
 at Heidi through various people's memories.
 The effect was muted in recollection, so I didn't trap myself in an infinite
 loop of watching her forever because she was 
\emph on
just that beautiful
\emph default
, but the aesthetic overload was still compelling.
 From Heidi's own perspective, she looked pretty, felt less so, and had
 mostly agreed to join the guard in order to get carte blanche to use her
 power on large groups.
 Before that, the threat of retaliation from the Volturi themselves had
 confined her to uninhabited areas most of the time.
 Imperfect control over her power could easily have her accidentally mesmerizing
 and having to cover up entire crowds of humans, which was conspicuous enough
 to get her into trouble.
 She'd turned up in Volterra and presented herself as a candidate for the
 guard when it occurred to her that they would probably not get her in trouble
 if she were useful to them.

After some time, earlier than I had the previous night because we were flying
 east, I fell asleep, holding Jake's hand as usual.

I woke up on a different plane, and discovered that Jake was alert.
 What had looked like a scratch on his neck before was completely gone.

Siobhan caught me up on what's going on.
 She said apparently the plan is for you to go into the village with the
 one vampire from the Isle of Man, and I asked if she was seriously sending
 in just the two of you, and she said yes, but made air quotes and rolled
 her eyes, so...
 do you know what that's about?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No...
 The idea behind sending me in is that the wolves won't attack me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I explained.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

And Nathan has a witchcraft power that gives him good timing, so he's not
 in that much danger either...
 he can dodge and stuff.

 The explanation didn't feel complete, but it seemed like a recipe for bad
 results to mess with Siobhan's magical plans.

Well, think about it like this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

The reason the wolves won't attack me is because I'm your imprint.
 But they can attack

We landed at Heathrow, and Siobhan exchanged a series of texts with Maggie
 (voice calls being unworkable due to the inaudibility of hidden persons)
 to determine where the British contingent was located.
 I wasn't sure why this required several texts, but Siobhan told me not
 to worry about it.
 Jake was able to move under his own power, and could have kept up even
 with me on his back if he'd phased, but Siobhan -- sensibly enough -- deemed
 this a poor idea.
 We went at his top running speed on two legs instead.
 When we arrived, Pera hid everybody there, rather than unhiding us (

Nathan and Siobhan were promptly engaged in a lighthearted (on his part)
 and exasperated (on hers) conversation about something unimportant.
 I killed time listening to Cath catch up with her assorted friends, most
 of whom seemed more than a little irked at her for getting them involved,
 especially since the ultimate plan didn't rely much on ordinary non-witch
 vampires and, except for Nathan, any of them could have stayed home.
 The London coven in particular weren't thrilled about sharing their territory.
 Ilario said something irrelevant that mysteriously calmed them all down.

After we'd been one excessively large group of vampires doing nothing in
 particular for about fifteen minutes, Pera made a little shrieking noise,
