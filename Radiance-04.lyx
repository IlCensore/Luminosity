\emph on
Elspeth
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jacob.
 He said my name like I'd never heard any word spoken, ever, some blend
 of worship and need and possessiveness.
 He 
\emph on
stated
\emph default
 it, like it was a fact all by itself: 
\emph on
Elspeth exists, and that is supremely important
\emph default
.
 His eyes were so 
\emph on
soft
\emph default
, like he was about to cry with happiness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stared back, but my face was less 
\emph on
imprint face
\emph default
 and more 
\emph on
deer in headlights face
\emph default
.
 I didn't know how to react at all.
 I'd never spoken a word to Jacob in my life, and he was 
\emph on
staring
\emph default
 at me like...
 like all of the other wolves looked at their imprints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What was this supposed to mean for 
\emph on
me
\emph default
? I was hidden.
 I'd stay that way until Pera unhid me.
 She was in the pack too, she was part of the flow of people around Jacob
 identifying him as the boss.
 If 
\emph on
he
\emph default
 wanted me to stay, would she ever let me go? But I had to go! I could travel
 with them for a while, but I needed to meet up with Mama! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I wondered about the other women, and little Claire, scattered
 around the camp and looking at me and Jacob to see what we would do --
 were they free to go? Pera was, obviously, except that her absence would
 cost lives; she might not 
\emph on
feel
\emph default
 free, being so necessary.
 And Claire was a child (but where were her parents? I remembered she was
 a Makah; 
\emph on
their
\emph default
 tribe hadn't been wiped out...) Maureen and Emily were also Makah.
 Thea's family in Forks, some troop of blondes like her, would probably
 be alive too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd never given any of this a second thought when Mama first recited their
 names for me.
 We didn't know if Jacob's pack was alive, or if they'd been captured by
 the Volturi, or 
\emph on
what
\emph default
.
 Mama never heard from them again after they left La Push for good.
 Puzzling over the moral issues of scooping up two-year-old Claire and bolting
 hadn't been an important task, then.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd fallen in with thieves; had I also fallen in with kidnappers? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama told me that wolves hate to be without their imprints.
 They can technically do it, if they have to, but they wouldn't choose it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But she also told me that wolves care very much about their imprints and
 will do what they need, be what they need.
 If anyone there had been kidnapped, it was because they weren't safe at
 home.
 So maybe I just needed to explain that I would be quite safe with Mama.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would he believe me? We 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 been attacked by kept wolves...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My brain was running in circles; I'm not very well designed for thinking
 things out by myself.
 Usually I would bring problems to Mama and she would help me.
 But Mama wasn't there.
 I didn't know what to do without her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jacob said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You look so afraid, please don't be afraid...
 I'm not going to hurt you, Elspeth...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I spun around and ran.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nobody chased me immediately, although I heard voices bubbling up and talking
 over each other the moment it was obvious what I was doing.
 I didn't go far.
 I had to be able to find my way back unless I wanted to be the equivalent
 of a ghost forever, wandering around in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hiding place
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But I needed to be by myself for a little bit and tackle the new, terrifying
 problem of 
\emph on
how to make decisions without Mama
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I look sixteen, I mostly act sixteen, but I'm 
\emph on
five
\emph default
 -- and a half -- and Mama has always been in charge since she found me
 and I've never seriously rebelled.
 I liked kissing Cody but I would never have done it 
\emph on
first
\emph default
, not without getting Mama to actually change her rule about boys.
 As soon as I thought of that I was ashamed of having kissed him even 
\emph on
second
\emph default
.
 Mama said I had to wait until I was 
\emph on
seven
\emph default
.
 I didn't 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 if she'd make an exception for a boy my own species and my own real age,
 because she wasn't there to ask.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't know what she'd say about Jacob either.
 I had 
\emph on
no idea
\emph default
.
 It was terrifying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It meant I had to decide all alone, or try to get help from people I barely
 knew who had other interests in the problem besides making me safe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama likes to talk about priorities.
 She told me once, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can only have one top priority.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I'm her top priority and that means I can trust her to look out for me
 no matter what.
 
\emph on
Anything
\emph default
 else she cares about that competes with me being okay will not be addressed
 until I am okay.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't know a lot about anyone else's priorities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't even know a lot about 
\emph on
mine
\emph default
.
 I never had to.
 Mama thinks it's important for people to know themselves, what they want
 and what they have and how they're going to make the first thing happen
 with the second thing.
 But I didn't see the need much while I was little and she decided everything.
 I had what Mama got for me.
 I wanted 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what was best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and Mama knew what that was, and she made sure I had it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stood in the forest, staring up at the sky where it peeked through the
 leaves, and I wished for my mama.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She would have thought about the problem and then she would have done what
 needed doing.
 Whisked me away, or hugged me and petted my hair until I felt better and
 sent me along to join the pack as Jacob's imprint, or -- or 
\emph on
something
\emph default
.
 She might have needed time to ask for more information or mull something
 over or get me to show her my feelings on the matter, but she would have
 thought of something and done it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only reason it didn't hit me so hard before was because I have rules
 about what to do when Mama says to run, all lined up ready to go when I
 needed them.
 But then Jacob had to 
\emph on
complicate
\emph default
 things.
 How would I get to where I needed to go and take my leave with him being
 all 
\emph on
imprinty
\emph default
 at me so I couldn't leave without hurting him, even if he'd let me go?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I knew it wasn't really his 
\emph on
fault
\emph default
.
 Imprinting is involuntary.
 But it left me with a problem and no Mama there to fix it for me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I sat under a tree, still squinting up at the sky.
 I heard footsteps, and turned to look, expecting Jacob.
 But it was Cody.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said awkwardly, sounding tired.
 Without the bouncy confidence he'd shown before, and in comparison to all
 the wolves I'd just seen, he looked thin and small, even though he's two
 inches taller than me and before I'd have said he was more 
\emph on
wiry
\emph default
 than 
\emph on
skinny
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are...
 you okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody sat down, at a comfortable ninety-degree angle instead of right next
 to me or facing me directly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want to talk about it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, trying not to cry.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But...
 but the person I want to talk to isn't here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want me to leave you alone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked tentatively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hate being alone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I just -- I had to -- he was 
\emph on
staring at me
\emph default
 and I didn't know what to do
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jake's...
 a good guy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I respect the hell out of Jake.
 Like, if you'd met him before I was born he would have had little devil
 horns and smoke would have come out of his ears, that's how much hell I
 respected out of him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I laughed in spite of myself.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who do you want to talk to?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My mama.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh.
 I'm sorry.
 Didn't, uh, didn't lift a ouija board the last time we raided a Wal-Mart,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She isn't dead,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, leaning against the tree bark and closing my eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody blinked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Beg pardon? Brady brought us up to speed on what the Volturi were saying
 and doing while he was a kept wolf, when he defected.
 They killed my parents 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 yours.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't want to talk anymore.
 Leaving my eyes closed, I held up my hand, offering to show what I was
 too tired to tell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He hesitated, but eventually he took my narrow hand in his broad one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Aunt Rosalie, smiling guiltily as she held me, while Grandpa Carlisle explained
 that Mama and Daddy had 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gone away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and would not be back, but that I didn't have to worry and would always
 be taken care of...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Walking through the park with the neighbor lady and her son and their dog,
 leading the dachshund into the trees, smelling something familiar and flowery,
 walking forward, leaving the animal behind, seeing Mama and knowing that
 Grandpa was wrong
\emph on
...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama explaining why Grandpa had said what he said, explaining about her
 shield, telling me that this was why I must run
\emph on
 without thinking of going back for her if she said to, and I knew without
 her saying so that she wished Daddy had run when he'd had the chance...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama showing me the bench in Central Park where I should check for her,
 once every day, until the month was up, if I did have to run; Mama telling
 me all the phone numbers she had so I would know who to go to for help
 if she couldn't be there, and the worry on her face when she told me the
 numbers were old but I should try anyway...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I let my arm fall and my eyes open.
 Cody had an absent, almost 
\emph on
awed
\emph default
 expression.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's alive,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he murmured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, anxious.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If it doesn't work twice, or if someone went back to check on her before
 she could get up and run away...
 but she's probably alive.
 That's why I have to go to New York.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you think...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Then he frowned and shook his head.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess it would only be her, she has the shield.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't be sorry your mom is alive,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, half-smiling.
 He held up a hand when I opened my mouth to correct him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know that's not what you meant.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm used to her being in charge of everything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know what to do without her.
 I thought it would be...
 maybe not easy, but straightforward, to just find her again if we did get
 separated.
 And then you said the pack could escort me and I thought that way it would
 be easy, 
\emph on
too
\emph default
, and now it's not that, and it's not straightforward anymore either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jake's a good guy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody repeated, slowly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I don't know him.
 And he doesn't know 
\emph on
me
\emph default
, either! I've never spoken 
\emph on
one word
\emph default
 to him, or shown him 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 thought, or 
\emph on
anything
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
what if he won't let me leave with Mama or even try to find her
\emph default
? I 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Whoa, whoa,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's not -- I don't think he's going to do that.
 I mean, he'd probably rather if you and your mom 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 stuck with us, yeah, but -- he wouldn't keep you prisoner.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Have any other imprints ever wanted to leave?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I...
 don't think so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said, frowning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What would happen if one did? Kim, maybe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, naming the only adult imprint without a baby or essential witchcraft.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I -- I guess since she's Quileute she probably has no close family left
 to go home to, but if she wanted to leave anyway?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jared would...
 he'd want to go with her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody slowly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He'd want to go wherever she went.
 But he'd try to convince her to stay, first.
 They'd be easy pickings alone.
 You won't have that problem, though, your mom will be with you, she's done
 fine at keeping you safe this long and the Volturi aren't after you in
 particular.
 Probably not even now.
 Wolves don't see well enough in the dark that the kept ones could have
 recognized her, and by the time a see-in-the-dark vampire showed up she
 wasn't...
 really...
 recognizeable.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What if...
 Suppose Pera could hide and unhide people without touching them, from any
 distance, and 
\emph on
she
\emph default
 wanted to leave, by herself, and only help remotely.
 It'd be safe for her to go.
 Would Brady let her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I...
 don't...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody was unsettled by the question.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't imagine her doing that.
 She's happy with Brady.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I pulled my knees up to my chin.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But you think that Jacob imprinting on me won't change anything, and I can
 still go meet Mama in Central Park and leave with her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I wouldn't say it doesn't change anything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody admitted.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

I know I keep saying this, but Jake's a good guy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why did you follow me out here, instead of someone else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uhhh...
 Jake thought you'd be more comfortable talking to me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody sheepishly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

since we were talking before and...
 since you ran away when you saw him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does he know that you kissed me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was hoping to avoid having to tell him that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It would be so awkward that auks would go extinct with envy.
 He'd either be pissed because you're 
\emph on
his
\emph default
 imprint or disgusted because we're technically five.
 Or both.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is too hard,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, burying my face in my knees.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I 
\emph on
am
\emph default
 five! I'm 
\emph on
five
\emph default
 and I want Mama to be in charge.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you want,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can go back and tell everyone about your mom so you don't have to explain.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I'm good at explaining things,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, but that doesn't mean you should 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to do it if you're all scrambled in the head about...
 stuff.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's nice of you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I know she told you all the facts about imprinting, but...

 Just the other day I was asking Mama for permission to let a boy take me

 said Cody softly.

And now, whatever you do, even if you go out for ice cream five thousand

\begin_inset Quotes eld

On the one hand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you should be able to have ice cream with anyone you want with whatever
 level of seriousness you want.
 Or -- or deer.
 I liked you myself, remember -- still do if I'm honest -- and then this

 more difficult.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And on the other hand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody waved his left hand, once, as though to designate it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This hand's the one that's thinking about Jake, who is a swell guy and who
 I'd like to see happy, and this hand is also doing some pondering about
 what happens to the pack if you leave and he's got to

handle his own issues
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Does...
 he really have a lot to do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I mean, Pera hiding everybody is the best possible defense, and I haven't

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not just defense,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, he's essential when a few of us unhide if there are kept wolves
 or vampires about.
 He's the best fighter by a long shot and the Alpha voice is the only thing
 that can override a couple of dangerous instincts, in emergencies, plus
 he coordinates everyone's movements.
 But if he couldn't lead, then we 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 just quit unhiding until he was up to scratch again.
 The real biggie would be order in the pack, day-to-day.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Like you wouldn't believe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody fervently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Early on, before we had Pera, there wasn't much, because it was just running,
 running, running, all the time.
 Maureen and Thea had their purses on them when we first escaped and Zachary
 had enough warning to grab his wallet, and we ate out of their savings
 accounts.
 The wolves went in shifts and slept while riding on whoever was awake so
 we didn't have to stop moving for more than a few minutes to grab food.
 So there was this all-consuming panic and an obvious common enemy.
 Infighting only got bad once everyone got used to the idea that we were
 safe while we hid.

What happened?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A lot of things happened.
 This was years ago, Jake was still only fifteen even though he looked almost
 like he does now.
 He wasn't comfortable throwing his authority around.
 He didn't want to be an Alpha, he'd only done it because it was the only
 way to not be attached to his sisters' packs anymore and escape.
 He'd spend a lot of time in wolf form, trying to talk to them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Alphas can talk to each other...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If they want to.
 It's not automatic, like it is within the pack.
 And Rachel and Becky weren't really interested in talking to him anymore.
 But he kept trying, and trying, getting more withdrawn, and things started
 to fall apart.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Like how?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Kim and Thea would have the most amazing fights, screaming at each other
 to wake the dead even if the dead were wearing earmuffs.
 Once Thea threw a shoe and clonked Kim on the head with it, and the next
 thing you know, Jared and Darren are at each others' throats defending
 their lady-loves.
 Claire would get on Emily's nerves sometimes, and Emily would snap at her
 and Claire'd get scared and run to Quil, and Quil would try to tell Emily
 off and Sam would threaten to perforate him for suggesting that Emily's
 anything less than the most perfect aunt in the universe to Claire.
 Zachary would make off-color jokes and they'd offend Maureen and she'd
 tell Victor to teach Zach how to behave like a civilized person, which
 apparently in Maureen-secret-code-language means `take half his pelt off'.
 Pera was kind of shell-shocked over having been kidnapped by the Volturi
 and then escaping, and she didn't speak more than ten words of English,
 then, so she kind of rebuffed Kim when Kim tried to be friends and then
 Brady was fighting with Jared over that.
 Those were the major themes, but almost every combination of people except
 wolves with their own imprints, and Jake, would be fighting sometimes.

Anyway, I really did stay out of it for the most part.
 Feel free to seek second opinions if you want, but all my memories are

\begin_layout Standard

Well, one day Jake didn't go off to try to talk to Becky and Rachel.
 He didn't make a production about it, he was just in the camp from the
 time he got up to bedtime, no fur on.
 There weren't any fights that day.
 Whenever it seemed like there might be one, Jake would give whoever was
 picking it a look.
 It's not like he was staring anyone down, daring them to try to start an
 argument under his nose.
 Nobody stopped dramatically in midsentence because they were scared he'd
 intervene.
 It just...
 didn't happen.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I asked, having expected something more cinematic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, of course not, that was only the first day.
 The next day, Jake slept in a bit, and Thea took Kim's hairbrush and from
 there everybody got into a combination shouting match and wolfy war.
 It was awful.
 Claire was wailing her head off a safe distance away.
 Quil was dividing his time between trying to comfort her and trying to
 bite Darren's head off.
 Pera had learned some English and she was threatening to unhide everyone
 and let us all die or get brain-fried for all she cared, and Maureen was
 pulling out the racial slurs over that.
 Brady went straight for Maureen without even trying to go through Victor
 and Victor nearly killed him.
 That kind of thing, flying every which way, I was up a tree for most of
 it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Jake slept through this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked skeptically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think so.
 I think he was waiting to get out of his tent until all the adults were
 involved so he could address everyone at once without anyone virtuously
 claiming innocence.
 He walked out and just said, `Cool it.' I can't tell when he's using Alpha
 voice and when he's not, but I'm pretty sure he was just then, because
 all the wolves stopped 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
, and the girls quit screaming soon after.
 Then Jake said he wanted to talk to everybody, one at a time, privately,
 no exceptions, and that he expected everyone he wasn't chatting with to
 behave themselves in his absence.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's thirteen people if he included Claire,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

How long did it take?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fourteen, counting me, and it took the entire rest of the day and a chunk

 He gave everybody at least an hour; a few people got more.
 I don't know exactly what he said to anyone but me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why were you on his list, if you weren't involved in any of the fights?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He said he was catching up on all his responsibilities and just because
 I was `acting more mature than all the teenagers in the pack put together'
 didn't necessarily mean I had nothing going on that needed to be addressed,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think he was collecting a complete list of grievances so he'd know just
 what everybody was fighting about and could deal with it.
 I wasn't very articulate then, of course, so I was saying things like `Thea
 yells really loud' and `it makes Claire scared when Quil fights the other
 wolves and sometimes she hits me because she is scared and I'm scared she
 might hurt her hand'.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He chuckled to himself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody went on, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

after he had talked to everybody, it was late -- I was already asleep, I
 can barely keep my eyes open past sunset.
 Jake sent everybody else to bed.
 I think he stayed up all night, though, because I was up at four-thirty
 in the morning and he was hanging out, wolf-shaped, in the middle of camp
 staring into space.
 I sat with him for a while, but he didn't phase, so I didn't try to carry
 on a conversation and eventually went off hunting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Once everybody was up, Jake started making announcements.
 He had a list of things we needed to get so nobody would feel like they
 had to steal each other's stuff.
 He had rules about what language was and wasn't appropriate.
 He talked about how everybody had better be nice to Pera because she was
 saving all of our lives constantly on a daily basis.
 He told Quil it was Quil's job to swoop Claire away from Emily 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 Emily got fed up with her -- since Quil can't get fed up with her.
 He Alpha-voiced all the wolves about fighting, and said if they felt like
 their imprints needed defending they should come to him about it and he'd
 sort it out.
 He told all the imprints except Claire that it was immature and ridiculous
 for them to resort to violence-by-proxy and if they couldn't handle their
 disagreements by themselves without shouting and throwing things, they
 could come to him instead of fracturing the pack over it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And then everything calmed down?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not just like that.
 But Jake enforced everything he said he was going to.
 Perfectly, every single time.
 Eventually fighting wasn't normal anymore,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But he still has to make himself a visible presence, has to be in the middle

 I don't like to think what would happen if anything happened to him.
