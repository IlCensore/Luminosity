\begin_layout Chapter
Things Left Behind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was wandering through the vicinity of Nashville, taking an uninhabited
 route to avoid being seen in the sun.
 I was starting to get a little thirsty, and my necklace and rings were
 on my locket chain, where they were less likely to be damaged by the one-sided
 fight between me and a coyote if I happened across one.
 When I went over a shallow rise, I saw him, clearly a vampire, from a few
 hundred feet away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took me longer than it should have to recognize him.
 He was alone, for one thing; no Alice.
 His outfit was nothing like the style that had been typical of Jasper before.
 When he was facing away from me, the hair was enough to make him look Jasper-li
ke in spite of that -- it was a little shaggier than I'd last seen, but
 the right color and type.
 But when he turned around, having heard my approach, his eyes were red.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figuring I'd been mistaken, and this vampire merely resembled Jasper, I
 stepped forward.
 I would have needed to run from Jasper before being recognized, lest he
 get in touch with the family and let them know I was alive.
 A stranger, on the other hand, I could interact with in relative safety.
 I hadn't encountered another nomad in all my wandering, but imagined it
 was customary for me to find out what this vampire's territory was so I
 could keep out of it or arrange to peaceably pass through.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the time I was close enough to see the web of scars on his face, and
 understand that it wasn't just some doppelganger, it was too late: he'd
 had the chance to see through my new hairdo.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bella,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I heard him growl.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I lied, and then I turned to run.
 I had a head start and I retraced the steps I'd taken, so I wouldn't be
 caught off guard by strange terrain.
 It took him almost twenty minutes to catch me.
 But catch me he did.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took my arm off, easily, still the consummate handler of newborns.
 Holding it hostage, he sprang back.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bella,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said again, keeping out of my reach as I lunged for my limb and hissed
 at the pain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Give it back.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I looked him in the eye -- what had he and Alice been 
\emph on
doing
\emph default
? What would have possessed them to return to eating humans? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was she? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he drawled, voice full of his native Southern accent.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I could use some news from home and you don't seem so inclined to give it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't have any.
 Give me my arm.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I looked at the limb, trying to use vision instead of confused kinesthetic
 sensation to make it attack him; it just flailed wildly.
 I couldn't even tell if I was really controlling it or if it was just twitching
 on its own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're looking rather well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 His tone was somehow harsh and languid at the same time.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The cancer patient look suits you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I launched myself at him, trying to grab my arm away.
 I actually managed it, through some fluke or just the power I could still
 put behind a leap, and I took off one of his hands off in the process.
 I ran again once I was clear, licking the severed edge of my arm so it
 would seal properly and attaching it back to my shoulder.
 I flung Jasper's hand away, hoping to distract him, and kept running.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From what I could hear, he wasn't even going after his hand.
 He was just chasing me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bella, dear sister,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he called.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's only me, Alice isn't here to stop me now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 What was 
\emph on
wrong
\emph default
 with him? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was Alice? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I asked him that: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is she?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I yelled, over my shoulder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That stopped him in his tracks.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked, barely loudly enough for me to hear over the wind in my ears.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stopped too, and looked over my shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's dead, Bella,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, sounding so lost that it was like he wasn't a powerful, leonine
 fighter missing a hand and covered in proof of his ability to take me apart.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice is dead.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The news hit me harder than I would have guessed.
 Alice.
 My sister, my friend -- dead.
 Little, happy Alice, dancing wherever she went -- dead.
 Just like Edward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
How?
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jasper started to lope towards me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Volturi,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, the lonely timbre receding from his voice as he returned to whatever
 mania had possessed him before I'd asked about her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Had one of Nahuel's sisters with them to block her vision, and a witch I've
 never seen before who works like Jane.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He sounded comfortable and casual by the time the sentence was over, in
 spite of the fact that there was no pleasant way he could have learned
 that the witch was similar to Jane.
 Something was definitely wrong with him.
 Some defense mechanism against dealing with Alice's death, spiraling out
 of control to make him unstable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And Alice?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I whispered, backing away from him.
 That was two new, powerful witches with the Volturi, Addy and whoever Jasper
 had seen.
 Maybe the sister of Nahuel's they'd recruited was the witch one too.
 Maybe this embarrassment of riches was why they'd been willing to kill
 my Edward, and Alice, who they'd wanted so badly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pain flashed back onto his face, but he controlled it again -- or it
 disappeared of its own accord.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alec knocked me over, deprived me of all the usual senses, but that doesn't
 cut the empathy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That works just fine...
 well, not on you, dear sister...
 but otherwise just fine...
 and I felt...
 Alice...
 die.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Except for the pauses, he could have been discussing any neutral subject,
 commenting on my scarf or something.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I kept backing up; he kept moving forward.
 He didn't seem to be paying any attention to what had to be an awful pain
 in his wrist, where his hand should have been.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why are your eyes red?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I whispered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because I've been eating people, dear sister.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He practically 
\emph on
purred

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But that was obvious, that he'd been eating people, didn't he understand
 why I'd ask...?

 he roared, suddenly all violence and fury.

 They had no excuse until you stepped out of line,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Okay!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I cried, and he calmed again, all the rage drained out of him like someone
 had tipped him over and poured it out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To answer your question,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said conversationally, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was originally able to stop eating people in the first place because,
 wouldn't you know it, they don't really like to be eaten.
 They tend to have strong feelings about it...
 not pleasant ones...
 Well, when I knew there was something else to be done, I was all too willing
 to try to leave that behind, although of course it was difficult.
 Dear.
 Sister.
 But now I find meals a pleasant respite.

If I feel 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he murmured, creeping forward as I scrambled back, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

if I focus on 
\emph on
their
\emph default
 terror, think about

their

 Dear, dear sister.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I whispered.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, don't be sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's really no point.
 I can't tell, you see.
 And besides...
 I'm going to kill you.

\begin_layout Standard
I would have died immediately if Jasper had been in his right mind and had
 both hands.
 But he was short a weapon, and his onslaught was clumsy and desperate.
 His attitude and his stance and his strategy shifted chaotically as he
 lunged and struck, and while it made him unpredictable, it sacrificed all
 of his follow-through.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was only April; I had almost two months left of newborn strength.
 Jasper seemed stronger than Emmett -- I remembered that drinking human
 blood conferred an improvement there -- but I was stronger still, and I
 could commit to my attacks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could, at least, until Jasper started talking again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you even love him?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, launching a kick to my head that turned into a mere acrobatic
 maneuver halfway through its journey when he changed his mind.
 I rolled away, kipped up, and then realized what he was talking about and
 found myself so stunned by the question that I couldn't dodge as he landed
 a solid punch to my sternum with his attached hand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I flew through the air; he was waiting when I landed and stomped on my knee,
 breaking my leg in half.
 I screamed and scrabbled for the lost leg, and Jasper chose to forego continuin
g to divide me from myself, instead saying, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because if you did love him...
 you'd be like me, now, wouldn't you?

 I picked up my leg, spat on it, and fused it back to my knee, then sprang
 to my feet and ran again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice didn't see it...
 too many wolves,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, sprinting after me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But we heard about it...
 you know, before they killed her because of you...
 Edward is dead, or did you somehow not know? Did you abandon him?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I shrieked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But you seem to be doing so well, Bella,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jasper snarled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course, I can't 
\emph on
tell
\emph default
, not really, but I'd think, if you loved him, that you'd be in more or
 less my boat...
 or you'd be barely awake, like Marcus...

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He caught up to me again, pushed himself into the air and aimed a foot
 squarely at the middle of my back.
 I had enough forward momentum that it didn't actually injure me, but it
 threw off my gait and I went tumbling forward down the slope I'd been following.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jasper stood at the top of the hill, watching me recover my feet.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't tell,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, shrugging, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

like I said.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Then he was after me again.
 I spun to connect a fist with his face as he approached.
 I missed his head, but caught the shoulder of his good arm.
 It came off.
 He didn't make any effort to retrieve it, just kept advancing; he was on
 me again in an instant, compensating for his rebalanced body well enough
 to land a kick at my throat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My neck cracked but didn't sever, and he stopped, 
\emph on
again
\emph default
, to taunt me while I gurgled and healed.
 The knitting wound was slower than the others -- I'd had to reattach an
 arm and a leg in the last minute; I wasn't made entirely of venom.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jasper said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know he loved you.
 And you felt something for him...
 I think...
 before I lost you.
 But did you 
\emph on
love
\emph default
 him? Really? Or are you immune to that too, dear sister?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He darted towards me to do more damage, when my neck was half healed, but
 I pushed at him with both hands and one foot and he went hurtling through
 the air.
 He skidded when he landed, not bothering to get his bearings again until
 my neck was glued whole and I was up and running again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Jasper ever got the presence of mind to pick up his lost appendages and
 seriously attack me without pause, I was dead.
 I needed to do something clever.
 He'd been reacting very strongly to Alice's name; it might throw him off
 enough that I could reason with him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice wouldn't want me dead!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I yelled.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped in his tracks, and I glanced over my shoulder to gauge his reaction.
 The lost, forlorn look again.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She loved you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 And then his face twisted with hate.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And you 
\emph on
betrayed
\emph default
 her.
 
\emph on
She loved you

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He gave chase again; I kept running, with enough of a start that I guessed
 he'd catch me again in four minutes.

\emph on
Could

 wanted a little

 He was raving enough that I might be able to convince him that it was a
 case of mistaken identity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't know how to make it

He 
\emph on
had

 I visualized my shield getting thinner, letting my emotions seep through.
 I didn't actually know what Jasper's range was, but he was catching up
 anyway; if it was working, he'd notice when he crossed it.
 I thought I could feel the press of my shield getting lighter or changing
 temperature or something -- it wasn't

He was not only confused about who I was, he was also willing to quit attacking

 If I could pass off the entire conversation...
 I ran through it again in my head.
 I hadn't

 although I'd need one hell of a story to cover my appearance

 a few of the things I'd said.
 If he really wasn't sure, though, I might be able to get out with no complete

 Had to cover the confusion about the red eyes.

Toodles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said, in the most uncharacteristic farewell I could think of, and I bolted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got out of the Nashville area without meeting Peter or Charlotte, and
 continued north once I had safely detoured.
 I thanked my lucky stars that my identifying jewelry had been tucked into
 my shirt, and I didn't dare take it out again until I'd crossed the state
 line.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

***

\begin_layout Standard
Jasper's accusations had shaken me, and when I was out of his coven's range
 and had coaxed my shield back to its normal strength, I tried to consider
 them.
 Of course if Jasper couldn't sense an emotion from me, that didn't necessarily
 mean it wasn't there...
 but did he have a point, however poorly derived? 
\emph on
Could
\emph default
 I be immune to the full force of the mate bond? It was the 
\emph on
sort
\emph default
 of thing I found myself impervious to.
 I felt like I'd been more powerfully connected to Edward than I'd imagined
 possible, but I didn't have a true basis for comparison.
 Edward would have, if he could read my mind, but he couldn't.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And...
 I 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 holding up better than Jasper.
 He was 
\emph on
hallucinating
\emph default
, he'd lapsed his vegetarianism, his mood and demeanor swung wildly all
 over the map from moment to moment.
 I 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 functioning better than Marcus.
 He was practically a zombie, after centuries without Didyme.
 And I was less obsessed with revenge than Irina.
 While I did want the Volturi dead, I'd already wanted that before they'd
 killed Edward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In short, I was 
\emph on
coping
\emph default
.
 I thought about Edward every single day, and hadn't managed to scale back
 my allotted four hours daily of dwelling on him and Elspeth, but I was
 having a life without him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the answer that Jasper had thought of -- that I just didn't 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 love Edward, that I was somehow protected from that too -- didn't feel
 right.
 I'd had to drag myself around by telling myself he'd have wanted me to
 live; I'd acquired more momentum over the months since, but the basic motivatio
n was still the same, if I looked at it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe there was some other explanation for why I was -- effectively -- managing.
 Irina's behavior was the least bizarre of the three examples -- and she,
 unlike Jasper or Marcus, wasn't a witch.
 Jasper had apparently 
\emph on
felt
\emph default
 Alice die.
 I allowed myself a shudder at how awful that must have been.
 Marcus saw relationships -- had he watched his wink out? Would that be
 a more affecting experience than mine, where I'd only had to 
\emph on
hear
\emph default
 myself widowed? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there was Elspeth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all that I thought it was idiotic for anyone to count having children
 as a kind of immortality on a par with the 
\emph on
regular
\emph default
 kind of immortality...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't 
\emph on
nothing
\emph default
.
 Elspeth was alive, might well live forever if she hadn't inherited my hubris,
 and she was Edward's daughter.
 Half him.
 Even if I couldn't see her, at least not until every threat were somehow
 extinguished in spite of the fact that the Volturi had at least two new
 witches and two packs of werewolves...
 she existed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was cold.
 But I knew

why
\emph default
 I was cold, I knew 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 I was missing, and that warmth hadn't gone out of the world, she was only
 far away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elspeth deserved to 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 a mother, a mother who wasn't a gibbering mess or an apathetic lump of
 misery, even if she couldn't be raised by that mother.
 Even if she had to think I was dead for the rest of her eternity.

I was passing through Michigan when I found her.

I heard her voice first.
 I knew it was her before I even processed the word she'd spoken.
 There was no mistaking it, even though I'd heard only the syllables she'd
 deigned to utter when she was days old.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I froze in my tracks.
 Michigan? There were no family houses I knew about in Michigan.
 They'd bought a new one, then.
 Moving around more to cover for Elspeth's growth.
 How big would she be now? 
\emph on
I should run, I should jump into Lake Huron and swim to Ontario, I can't

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what if she said something else? What if she spoke again, and I missed
 it? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word she'd said was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

puppy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That was...
 odd.
 Vampires, at least full ones, couldn't be around animals without the animals
 going out of their minds trying to get away; that was fine when we were
 going to eat the creatures anyway, but it would be a suspicious pattern
 of behavior to inspire in pets.
 Why would she be around a puppy? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Was my daughter 
\emph on
unsupervised
\emph default
? Were they leaving her by herself, that she'd found a dog that wasn't barking
 its head off about the presence of vampires? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I listened more carefully.
 There were at least two people with her -- heartbeats, at human speed.
 I'd entrusted my daughter to my in-laws and they were leaving her with
 a 
\emph on
babysitter
\emph default
? Why were they not with her, in one combination or another, every minute
 of the day? What were they doing that was so important that they'd hand
 off my baby to someone else? One of the humans was an adult -- a woman,
 it sounded like -- the other a child.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elspeth said something again: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can I walk the puppy in the forest?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It wasn't really a forest, just a cluster of trees in a park, barely thick
 enough to obscure vision.
 If I ran six steps forward to its edge I might be able to glimpse her.
 I barely, 
\emph on
barely
\emph default
 stayed put.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All right, Elsie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the woman, and my daughter laughed with glee, and my heart would have
 stopped if it had been running.
 More footsteps, a dog's and a little girl's...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was coming closer.
 I should run.
 If she saw me, if she smelled me, if she had any inkling that I was here,
 she could tell anyone about it, could tell my 
\emph on
neglectful
\emph default
 erstwhile siblings and parents-in-law about how she'd run into me.
 After she got home from her day with the 
\emph on
babysitter
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But my body was obedient to what I really wanted, and I 
\emph on
wanted
\emph default
 to see my child again.
 She walked closer still.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the footsteps stopped.
 I heard her sniffing the air.
 The dog was sniffing, too, and started to whine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mama?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Elspeth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every thought of running away evaporated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could not, 
\emph on
could not
\emph default
 leave.
 Not now.
 Not anymore.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mama?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Elspeth again, and she was getting closer.
 She was having to fight the dog to do it; I could tell by listening that
 she was stronger than it was, but it was very determined not to approach
 nearer.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Silly puppy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, and I thought I heard her hook the leash over a branch to make
 the animal stay while she investigated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She pushed branches aside, and I couldn't breathe, and I couldn't move,
 and then she came into view.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mama!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she exclaimed.
 She looked like a tall five-year-old, maybe a skinny six-year-old.
 Her hair -- 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 hair, exactly the shade, bronzed and brilliant -- fell in waves to her
 knees.
 Her eyes were still that same brown that her father had loved so much.
 Someone had put her in a spring green outfit with daisies on it.
 She was the most beautiful thing in the universe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't think the human would have been able to hear her speaking to me.
 She rushed forward, jumped into my arms as they folded around her automatically
, and planted her hand on my face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Memories flooded past.
 Everything.
 Every instant of her childhood stolen from me, I could have it all back.
 I'd never be able to put her down, never be able to tell her to keep me
 a secret and send her back to the babysitter and the other child with the
 dog.
 I was going to have to steal her away; there was nothing else I was strong
 enough to do.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I whispered, interrupting her.
 There were too many lost minutes for me to make them all up standing in
 a park some insufficient handful of miles away from her ostensible caretakers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What, Mama?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she replied, leaving her hot hand on my face but halting the flow of shared
 memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can you show me what happened right before you came to the park, please?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She beamed at me and did exactly that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The woman and her little son were the Cullens' next door neighbors at their
 current residence.
 They had a dachshund, which Elspeth found fascinating, but which the regular
 vampires had to pretend to be allergic to.
 The neighbor lady had offered to bring Elspeth along on the dog's walk,
 and Elspeth had begged to go, and they'd seen no harm in it: she was smart
 enough to keep her extraordinary qualities to herself, and to stay quiet
 about the oddities of her relatives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The human was starting to wonder at how long Elspeth had 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Finally, my feet at last were willing to move, now that she was in my arms.
 The human was meandering towards the cluster of trees.
 If I bolted, now, and got into the water as soon as I could to disrupt
 my trail, and it took the human even a couple of minutes to give up looking
 and contact one of the Cullens, then I had a shot at evading detection.
 Unless...
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, did you ever meet a vampire man named Demetri?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She shook her head, and showed me every male vampire she'd ever met, including
 Edward, but remembering him didn't hurt as much as it would have without
 her right there.
 Edward, Carlisle, Emmett, Jasper, Ilario, Eleazar, David, that was all
 -- apparently if a contingent of Volturi had visited the family they'd
 been all women.
 Demetri hadn't met her.
 We couldn't be tracked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I clutched at Elspeth and I ran.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I needed to cut off our trail.
 But Elspeth needed to breathe, which made sustained, discreet underwater
 travel challenging.
 No one who would be looking for me was a tracker.
 Without any witches to help them, the family was limited to scent and tradition
al detective work to follow me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After even a few minutes for the trail to cool, scent alone wouldn't be
 enough to identify 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 specifically, although they'd know 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 vampire was involved.
 The distinguishing features of a person's scent evaporated much more quickly,
 so they'd only be able to tell my species, not recognize my person.
 I could confuse my trail to the point of untrackability in a sufficiently
 crowded area.
 But the crowds could be questioned later, and might remember us.
 Water would really be best if we could manage it.
 My backpack was fortunately waterproof; I'd considered that an important
 feature when I'd bought it, considering my penchant for aquatic food.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, sweetie, do you happen to know how long you can hold your breath?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A whole minute!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she bragged, sending me the relevant memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't pull any oxygen out of the air I inhaled.
 If we both held our breaths, and I carried her in one arm and dove underwater,
 we could stay underwater for two minutes at a time if I gave her my air.
 That wasn't enough time to get out of visual range from a speedboat if
 someone on it spotted us and knew which direction to go, but it 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 enough time to get far enough away to confuse anyone who thought we were
 human.
 I could pop up in unpredictable locations and be unfollowable.
 All they'd be able to tell, if they were questioned later, would be that
 we'd been in the lake.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd avoid spending too long in the water -- I just needed to break my trail,
 and then there would be thousands of miles of coastline on which I 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 have emerged.
 By the time they found the specific beach we'd come out on the scent would
 be long gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I clung to uninhabited areas so I could run instead of walking until I got
 to the edge of the water.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're going to swim across this lake,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told Elspeth, after confirming that there was no one along the stretch
 of coast I'd found.
 I explained how we were going to stay underwater, made sure she knew to
 poke me if she needed air early, and dove in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I managed to stay out of the paths of boats for the entire trip across the
 lake.
 The swim took four hours, but Elspeth was very patient about it, and looked
 fascinated by the fish we passed.
 We climbed out on a beach in Ontario, and it was already after dark.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm hungry, Mama,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Elspeth informed me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay, Elspeth, I'll get you something to eat,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I promised.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need to figure out where we are first.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I never got to hunt with you before, I'm excited,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she announced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You've been hunting?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, blinking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She showed me.
 They'd been feeding her animal blood.
 Or rather, taking her along on hunting trips and letting her get it for
 herself, which she'd become capable of months previously.
 I 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 annoyed that my dietary regimen had been thrown out the window once I was
 out of the picture, but on the other hand, wild animals were free and human
 food wasn't.
 I didn't have access to deep pockets full of ancient fortune anymore.
 It was probably better, all things considered, if she hunted for food.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I ran along a highway, slowing to a walk whenever I heard a car coming,
 until I arrived in a town.
 I found a convenience store that was open, read an atlas with one hand
 to avoid having to put Elspeth down, and identified an area that was unlikely
 to be inhabited where she could hunt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You have to put me down so I can chase stuff,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she pointed out when we'd arrived.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't want to let her go.
 But she did need to eat, and if she was accustomed to bringing down her
 own food...
 I set her on her feet.
 She ran lightly ahead of me, and I jogged behind, just keeping her in sight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elspeth drained two raccoons and a small deer, then announced she was done.
 She had good table manners, which was a relief, because replacing her clothes
 every time she ate would have gotten very expensive and I only had a few
 hundred dollars left from snow shoveling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She didn't protest at all when I scooped her up again.
 She fell asleep in my arms as I ran, heading nowhere in particular except
 away from the lake.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It occurred to me to feel bad for Carlisle and Esme and Emmett and Rosalie.
 They wouldn't know what had happened to Elspeth.
 I also worried vaguely about the neighbor who'd taken her to the park being
 suspected of having something to do with it.
 But there was no way to let it be known that she was okay, that the neighbor
 was innocent, without making my survival an even more obvious hypothesis
 than it already was.
 I had to stay 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If she just vanished without a trace, any nomadic vampire accustomed to
 helping him or herself to interesting live curios could have been the culprit.
 If she kept in touch with her grandparents and aunt and uncle, on the other
 hand, that sharply narrowed the field of suspects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe when she was older, there would be some workaround.
 She could claim to have escaped a captor or something, once grown, without
 being young enough that they'd insist on her coming to live with them again.
 Elspeth's adulthood was only a few years away.
 They could fret over it for that long.
 My 
\emph on
parents
\emph default
 had to think that 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 was dead for longer, possibly forever.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the meantime, I had my daughter, and I could keep her, and she was warm
