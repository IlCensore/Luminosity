\begin_layout Chapter
The Cullens
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On my second day of school, I spent most of the morning dreading lunch.
 Mike sat with me in English and whisked me away to my second class before
 Eric could step in -- Eric's disappointment was concerning -- but to the
 general population I was less the center of attention.
 The classes were no more or less interesting than they had been the previous
 day, and that meant there was very little to distract me from the hamster
 in my head running endlessly over and over 
\emph on
What is Edward's 
\noun on

\emph default
 At lunch, we'd be in the same room again, and he might\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 Okay, I felt dumb
 panicking that he might

 at me, when I put it in words.
 But he 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 and it was not 
\emph on
pleasant
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jessica and I walked together to the cafeteria, where Mike spotted us and
 steered us towards his table (to Jessica's obvious delight -- that was
 something to write down later).
 Jessica's other friends, including Angela, found us there and collected
 around us.
 Once I'd settled in and looked around, I found that Edward's four siblings
 were at their usual table.
 Edward was not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't show up for the duration of the lunch period, and I practically
 had a spring in my step by the time Angela, Mike and I headed to Biology.
 I gave them my spiel about wanting a lab partner willing to help, augmented
 by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and now Edward is 
\emph on
absent!
\emph default
 What am I supposed to do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Mike took this opportunity to turn up the useful tidbit that Edward, as
 well as the other Cullens and the Hales, actually missed a fair amount
 of school -- on nice days the family were outdoorsy enough to skip classes
 for hikes and camping trips.
 I got Angela's permission (and Mike's unspoken disappointment) to try to
 swap lab partners and work instead with her; she guessed that her current
 one wouldn't mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The switch went pretty easily.
 I didn't even have to recite my entire speech to the biology teacher before
 he perfunctorily asked Angela's partner if she'd be okay to sit with Edward,
 got an apathetic shrug, and made the rearrangements.
 Sitting with Angela was pleasant.
 She was quiet -- a bit like Charlie, speaking if there was cause but not
 fighting silence like a hated foe.
 Once, she asked me a question about how the material we were looking at
 compared to the similar content I'd covered in Phoenix, and we had a murmured
 exchange that, being topical, went unpunished by the teacher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hurried to gym, ironically, and found the coach and recited a litany of
 excuses: I had the balance of a toddler -- a 
\emph on
drunk
\emph default
 toddler -- and the bruising potential of an overripe nectarine and I promised
 to practice yoga out of a book at home on a soft surface every day if I
 could please, please, please be excused from volleyball and nearly everything
 else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understandably, the coach wasn't impressed by my yoga promises, but said
 I could take a mat and put it in the corner of the gym and do the exercises
 there during classes where I could be officially monitored.
 I would still most likely fall a lot, but onto something yielding and not
 into any innocent bystanders.
 I could live with that.
 I was less happy about the coach insinuating that maybe we should have
 official Yoga Fridays and I could lead them if I was so into the practice.
 I wasn't actually 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 at yoga.
 It was just not as likely to send me careening into walls as volleyball.
 Perhaps she would forget about it; I didn't see a way to discourage the
 plan at that exact moment without making my promise to pursue the exercise
 seem less credible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forgotten
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my gym clothes, as emergency backup volleyball avoidance, and so I sat
 out for the second day in a row, but with my alternative arrangement in
 place I planned to be equipped the next day.
 It would have been embarrassing to flunk gym.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After school, I needed to make a grocery run: when I was at Charlie's, food
 was my domain, due to his lack of skill at or interest in cooking and tendency
 to forget that he needed to eat.
 On my way out of the campus lot, I noticed the two Cullens and Hale twins
 who'd attended school that day getting into their car: it was the shiny
 Volvo.
 Of course.
 It would be just silly if they had looks and not money too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grocery shopping wasn't a very mentally taxing activity, and so I spent
 most of the trip actively trying not to dwell on Edward.
 There was no good reason for me to be doing so, especially not after an
 entire day where he had not even appeared.
 That meant I was dwelling on him for 
\emph on
bad
\emph default
 reasons, and those weren't likely to go away and quit bugging me until
 I ferreted out what they were.
 What bad reasons would be prompting these thoughts?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, first, to get it out of the way, he was attractive.
 Very.
 Not in how he acted -- just visually and in terms of what I'd heard of
 his voice.
 That had to be tweaking something on a subconscious level; I wouldn't necessari
ly have felt less threatened if an ugly boy had scowled at me the same way,
 but I wouldn't have been so self-conscious about it.
 I probably would have figured that it was his problem.
 Which was a hint that it 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 his problem, and I shouldn't consider it evidence that I'd done anything
 wrong.
 Edward was just a bizarre guy who'd taken an arbitrary dislike to me where
 no one else had, and he'd chosen to express it in the form of hostile staring.
 The fact that he was pretty made this no more or less likely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, it was unexplained.
 That made it nigglingly mysterious.
 It only helped to care about mysteries if there was a sensible route towards
 solving them available, though.
 Now that I thought about it, it might be safe to ask one of his siblings\SpecialChar \ldots{}
?
 None of 
\emph on
them
\emph default
 had looked at me at all strangely.
 Of the four I guessed that Alice, the smaller, less runway-model-looking
 girl, would be most approachable.
 I didn't have information about any of their personalities, but appearance
 was to some extent a personal choice, and so in the absence of better ways
 to tell it wasn't worthless to guess based on how she looked.
 However, I decided it would be better to put that possibility off until
 and unless Edward pulled something worse than glaring at me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, it felt risky.
 I had no strong reason to believe it was 
\emph on
actually
\emph default
 risky.
 Driving my truck in the rain to and from the Thriftway for eggs and bread
 was probably more likely to kill me than Edward, just based on how many
 people died in car accidents and how many people were slain by inexplicably
 provoked classmates on an annual basis.
 But an angry face on another person was more the sort of thing I was wired
 to fear than a lump of metal under my direct control.
 The brain was evolved to work out social problems, not to worry about the
 relative danger of controlling vehicles on wet pavement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd run through all these thoughts by the time I wheeled my cart to the
 checkout.
 They helped.
 Simply 
\emph on
observing
\emph default
 the thought processes that led to some intrusive notion was so useful;
 I was confused about the fact that others never seemed to do it.
 RenÃ©e's ability to worry was limited only by her attention span.
 Charlie, if he had the tendency of dwelling to begin with, was subtler
 about it.
 I didn't see signs of the ability to consciously shut down pointless woolgather
ing in any of my peers.
 I supposed I should actually ask some -- later, after I had closer friends
 in Forks who wouldn't find the one comment enough to consider me weird,
 instead of so early in their formations of impressions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went home, made egg salad so dinner would already be done whenever Charlie
 got home, and replied to RenÃ©e's e-mail that had arrived while I was at
 school.
 Then I occupied myself by writing down as many of the things I'd decided
 to write down as I could remember.
 When I'd exhausted them I got started on my math homework.
 I heard Charlie come home some hours later, and went down the stairs so
 we could eat together.

He served himself a generous helping, looking appreciative, and I scooped
 out a small plateful for myself.

I have a couple classes with a girl named Jessica, and Angela's my lab partner

 And I also met a boy named Eric and one named Mike -- they're friendly.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I didn't mention Edward.
 There was nothing worth involving Charlie in, and anyway, he was clearly
 hoping for positive news, of which there was no shortage.

\begin_layout Standard
I'd never asked Charlie much about the people of Forks, but now that I thought
 of it, I supposed he must have met many of them.
 It would be likely less fruitful, but also much cheaper, to ask him rather
 than Alice -- obliquely, of course.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I inquired.

I meant more the kids -- they stick out some at school, I was curious.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Charlie surprised me with a medium-sized speech about how the Cullen kids
 had surpassed all of his expectations since they'd moved into town, never
 gave him a speck of trouble, were unfailingly polite, and all went on regular
 camping trips as a healthy family bonding experience.
 He seemed to be reacting more to some background hum of gossip, like what
 I'd heard from Jessica, than to anything I'd said.
 Apparently he was upset that the locals felt the need to make unkind comments
 about the Cullens when Forks was so lucky to have such a fine doctor in
 residence.
 I nodded along as he talked; the only one of the family I'd 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

met
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 had not made such a splendid impression and I couldn't honestly chime in
 with verbal agreement.
 But if my father the police chief found the family so clean-cut and worthy
 of praise, that was some evidence in favor of the danger being imaginary.
 Most violence came with priors.
 I felt a bit better.

\begin_layout Standard
Edward was not in school for the rest of the week.
 I settled into the routine of school: English with Mike and Eric sitting
 on either side of me, competing for my attention during the moments before
 and after class.
 Government, Trig, Spanish, lunch, biology, and yoga in the corner of the
 gym.
 I discovered to my surprise that I 
\emph on
liked
\emph default
 yoga; it was easy to think during the languid motions from pose to pose.
 I wasn't doing anything complicated, mostly just stretches and so on --
 and I avoided standing postures so I would be less likely to topple over
 -- but the teacher didn't complain, just looked my way periodically to
 make sure I wasn't goofing off during class.
 The group I sat with at lunch, led by Mike, made plans to take a trip to
 La Push Ocean Park in a few weeks -- an unfamiliar sort of beach, but a
 beach, and I decided to go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By Friday I started to suspect that Edward had dropped out of school or
 something.
 The mystery was compounded, not relieved, by his absence, and the small
 town failed me with its lack of plausible gossip.
 This was odd, given that asking Jessica could yield information of the
 most personal sort about everyone else; I encountered more rumors about
 drinking problems and scandalous pregnancies and business trajectories
 than I could keep straight.
 Why shouldn't she be able to report on Edward?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 didn't think I was horrifying enough to cause 
\emph on
anyone
\emph default
 to drop out of school altogether.
 I tentatively concluded that he'd looked at me horribly simply because
 my timing was bad and I'd arrived the day before some unwelcome event took
 him away from Forks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weekend was tranquil.
 Charlie worked most of it; he'd gotten into the habit of spending every
 day on the job when the alternative was puttering around an empty house,
 and typically took off only when there was urgent fishing to do.
 I went to the library, found it pitiful, and added a plaintive note about
 that in my new e-mail to RenÃ©e.
 Later I'd have to go to some larger settlement, Olympia or Seattle, and
 spend all day in a good bookstore, spending the money I would have blown
 on a car if not for Charlie's gift -- on books, and on gas for the truck,
 because it got awful mileage and I needed to budget separately for that
 expense on a trip that big.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Monday, it was cold.
 People in the parking lot greeted me by name; in the cases where I knew
 theirs, I did the same, and otherwise I just smiled and waved and offered
 a more generic hello.
 I was comfortable.
 It was nice.
 The classes were mind-numbing, but I was pretty pleased with the student
 body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After English, it turned out to be snowing, and I stopped to marvel when
 I walked out of the building, staring up at the descending wisps of cottony
 precipitation.
 Mike thought this was amusing.

 I said.
 Mike laughed.
 Then a ball of slush hit him in the back of the head.
 I tracked its path and noticed Eric hurrying away, in the wrong direction
 for his next class.
 Mike bent down and started collecting his own snowball.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See you at lunch,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told him, moving away briskly.
 I thought snow was pretty, but I suspected my affection for it would be
 destroyed if I had to encounter it in the form of crossfire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snow -- first of its kind for the calendar year -- was the talk of the
 school all morning, which would have made more sense if it had been snowing
 in Phoenix.
 Nevertheless, I didn't find it hard to muster enthusiasm, since it was
 genuinely novel to me.
 I managed to avoid the hurtling snow missiles between all of the buildings
 I was obliged to travel to; Jessica, walking with me to lunch, thought
 my caution was silly, but didn't attack me with a frozen projectile herself.
 Mike caught up with us near the cafeteria doors, laughing as melting ice
 destroyed the painstaking spikes in his hair.
 Jessica drew him into a discussion of snowball fight tactics as we headed
 for the food and I habitually glanced at the Cullen's table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were five people there.

 Jessica asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 We waited in line, got our food and beverages, and headed for our table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mike was very concerned about my health, and kept asking if I was sure I
 was all right.
 I considered faking an illness and skipping Biology in the nurse's office.
 Bad idea, I decided.
 I couldn't do that forever, and it wouldn't get me any closer to understanding
 what was going on.
 I would just stick close to Angela and ignore Edward as much as I could.
 But I couldn't resist looking over once, to make sure he wasn't glowering
 at me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward wasn't looking at me at all, and he was laughing -- the entire family
 was.
 The boys all had snow in their hair, and Emmett was shaking his head to
 fling it out towards the sisters.
 Alice was using her lunch tray as a shield.
 It was picturesque, and I looked a little more intently, trying to figure
 out where the fury I so strongly associated with Edward had gone.
 Without it he didn't look half so predatory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bella, what are you staring at?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Jessica asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And just then, Edward looked over and made direct eye contact with me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I ducked my head immediately, caught, but I was sure he hadn't looked as
 full of rage has he had before.
 Just curious again, as he had been the last time this had happened in the
 cafeteria instead of the biology room.
 Were his attitudes determined by the 
\emph on
room?
\emph default
 How bizarre would that be?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Jessica giggled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She probably would have mentioned it if he'd started looking murderous
 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yep,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she teased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please stop looking at him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 I turned towards Mike's conversation in progress -- elaborate snow-enhanced
 battle plans -- and kept my eyes to my own table for the rest of the lunch
 period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Mike and Angela and I left the cafeteria together to head to Biology,
 the snow had turned to rain, and all of his weaponry was in the process
 of melting.
 He, and most of the other students, groaned.
 I was relieved not to have to fear snowballs between classes, and although
 I did miss the decoration, I hadn't fancied trying to drive home in my
 very first snowfall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was glad that I had changed lab partners and that I didn't have to sit
 right next to Edward after his absence.
 Especially since he had a brief, bizarrely heated exchange with the teacher
 about the new seating chart before finally taking his place next to Angela's
 former neighbor.
 I couldn't hear most of it, but his tone was incredulous, and the girl
 he was to share his table with was closer to the front of the room and
 looked vaguely offended.
 And then Edward stared at me again.
 Not angrily.
 Just frustrated, as the first time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I turned my attention to the lab when the teacher finished setting up and
 told us to start identifying the phases of mitosis on our microscope slides.
 Angela and I worked well together; we alternated checking the slides first
 and then checked one another's work, with her making one error that I caught
 and, as far as we could tell, none on my part.
 While she copied our answers onto the sheet, I glanced around the room.
 One of the pairs had a book open under the table, trying to hide the forbidden
 reference from the teacher.
 Mike and his partner kept swapping between two slides, comparing them.
 Edward was staring at me again, and his lab partner was gazing into space;
 either they'd completed the assignment before anyone else, or they had
 both decided to ignore it completely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His eyes were dark gold.
 I was sure they'd been black before.
 I hadn't written it down and 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 be misremembering\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 but I was 
\emph on
sure
\emph default
 they had been black.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked away again.
 Angela's handwriting was very tidy and so she was doing all of our recording,
 but she had noted in the margins who identified which slides first and
 the one mistake that I had caught so the credit was shared appropriately.
 I smiled and murmured to her that I appreciated it, and she smiled warmly,
 thanking me in turn for spotting the mis-identification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The teacher came around and noted everyone's scores.
 I was able to just barely overhear that Edward and his partner had gotten
 full marks: speed, then, not abandonment.
 Angela and I, plus one other pair, did equally well; everyone else had
 something missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a brief hubbub as equipment was put away and the teacher recorded
 our scores in his grade book, and then collective focus turned to the transpare
ncies he used to explain the lab.
 I zoned out a little, mostly just staring at the bright rectangle at the
 front of the room with pictures of cells in it.
 Sometimes I checked to see where Edward's attention was.
 Every time it was on me.
 I wondered if the teacher noticed.
 The fact that he consistently turned out to be staring at me only made
 me more tempted to check repeatedly.
 Finally I made a face at him -- trying to convey something like,

 with my eyes -- and he turned towards the front of the room for the rest
 of the class, body language tense but his visual focus off me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edward raced nimbly out of the room when the bell rang.
 I'd half suspected that he'd lurk on the route to gym and accost me when
 I walked by, demanding whatever secret he found so frustrating.
 I stuck close to Mike.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I stuck to a simple set of four poses during my yoga session to leave me
 more focus for thinking.
 I decided that unremitting staring was probably a significant enough act
 of harassment that, if I thought I needed it, I could get faculty attention
 about it.
 I resolved that Edward had two days to cut it out or I'd try to speak to
 Alice, and if that didn't turn up anything, he had a week and I'd speak
 to the biology teacher, and if that came to nothing, I'd wait another week
 and involve Charlie.
 Charlie's approval of the family would not, I was sure, stand up to my
 complaint, especially when I could probably get the also-approved-of Mike
 to back me up.
 After two more weeks of staring, if it got that bad, Mike would notice
 something.
 He was attentive enough.
 (I still needed to think of something to do about 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
After gym, I went to my truck, hopped in the cab, and ran the heater to
 warm my hands so I could comfortably grip the steering wheel.
 After a minute I started to poke along out of the lot.
 On my way out, I spotted Edward and Alice standing near the family Volvo.
 It looked like they were arguing.
 They weren't loud enough for me to have heard them, even if I'd cut the
 engine and rolled down a window, but it was clearly intense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd never even had a bizarre intermittent staring match with

 There was nothing she knew or thought about me to argue for or against.
 I continued towards home.

The next morning, I drove to school as usual, parked, and got out of my

 It made an awful noise, and I lost some paint, but I didn't doubt it would

I would have been standing in the path of the van if Alice hadn't pulled

Alice no longer seemed to find it necessary to hold my arm in her vice of

 she wouldn't mind my clinging back just a little bit.

 I made a small burbling sound.

I wobbled in place, wrapped around Alice's unprotesting arm and trying not

 Between the ice and the fact that I'd just nearly been trapped between

Tyler Crowley was the van's driver; I recognized him from my Government

 He'd gotten a few small cuts, but looked mostly okay; without any humans

Tyler was back in school by the time Government started, and he apologized
 profusely about the minor scratches to my car.
 His face was covered in band-aids that stood out brightly beige against

 They were all consistent with her manifest preferences (no mayonnaise,

 My past experience with talking extensively about food preferences tended
 to involve people going on about the little details.
 If they liked cheese, they'd mention in an aside that Camembert was only
 worth eating from a particular creamery.
 Chocolate lovers would have a story about which shop gave out a free sample

 Fans of quiche would take a moment to dispel the myth that it was difficult

 Anyone who brought up potato salad would also have a longstanding recipe
 rivalry with a neighbor.

I moved back to my usual lunch group with my taco and soda.
 My friends wanted to know what the deal had been with Alice, but I honestly
 had only fragments of likely-misleading clues, and the topic soon fizzled
 out as they lost interest in exotic speculations.
 The topic turned to the upcoming beach trip.
 I sat through this part of the exchange silently except for the necessary
 noises of assent and enthusiasm, and thought about the Cullen family.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was trying to avoid excessive notebook use in school, around Jessica in
 particular -- her tendency towards indiscriminate gossip wasn't showing
 any signs of being a fluke -- and so I couldn't organize my wisps of thought
 visually, as helpful as it would have been.
 I closed my eyes, adding a feigned tired sigh, and tried to make an imaginary
 sketch of the mystery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cullens were rich.
 Dr.
 Cullen was, well, a doctor, and by Charlie's account a very good one.
 If he had worked at a better-paying hospital for some years, and saved
 very much more carefully than most people were capable of, then that might
 explain it alone.
 But they were a young couple.
 Medical school took a long time.
 It seemed\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 not impossible, but unlikely, that there would have been not
 a speck of a murmur about it if Dr.
 Cullen had been a child prodigy who'd graduated medical school when he
 was fourteen, or something.
 As far as I knew, Mrs.
 Cullen didn't work.
 They had five children to feed (they 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 to eat, in spite of how Alice had acted and the fact that I'd never seen
 one of them do it -- were they concealing outrageously restrictive food
 allergies or a religious dietary requirement that embarrassed them for
 some reason?) and clothe and keep in trendy school supplies, plus a house.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Were
\emph default
 there any really big hospitals in Alaska that could have paid Dr.
 Cullen a great salary? It wasn't the 
\emph on
least
\emph default
 populous state, but it was way down there, spread out over the largest
 area.
 If there was an expensive research clinic or something in Anchorage, I
 supposed I wouldn't have known about it, so it was possible that Dr.
 Cullen had spent several years living cheap and only two years ago suddenly
 cut his income, moved to a small town, and started providing his children
 with a shiny car and sizable clothing budgets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was not impossible that the Hales' parents had left the Cullens some
 money in their wills.
 Or that when the Cullen children were adopted, they came with monetary
 bonuses to help with their care (and I didn't know how long those three
 had been in the family, except that it was longer than two years).
 Or that they were wealthy independent of the doctor's income for some other
 reason.
 But that, too, seemed like something I'd have heard a rumor about.
 There was little to no way that a resident of Forks was a lottery winner
 or the heir to a diamond cartel or a trust fund baby or something similarly
 dramatic and pecuniary without it being branded on their forehead forever
 by public chat.
 Jessica had proven able to divulge astonishingly personal things.

 I knew it was hard to adopt children -- if the Hales were Mrs.
 Cullen's niece and nephew, that did some explanatory work, but Edward,
 Emmett, and Alice were from some other source.
 Didn't it take years of paperwork and waiting to get a child? I supposed
 it was faster if one was willing to take an older adoptee -- but then,
 it was slower if you wanted a white kid, one without developmental problems.
 (This was evidence in

favor
\emph default
 of the hypothesis that Alice, and possibly Edward, were insane, which would
 have made them easier to adopt.
 I didn't know about Emmett.
 But they all did well in school and largely kept to themselves and Charlie

And it was known that Mrs.

 Since her husband was a doctor, that

The timeline just didn't shake out naturally.
 I was placing a lot of faith in Forks's rumor mill, but it was a very good

 I guessed that Dr.
 Cullen was thirty-five at the

 oldest.
 He was supposed to look a decade younger than that.
 If he'd finished high school when he was sixteen, say -- he probably could
 have skipped a grade or two back in elementary school without that making
 its way to my ears -- and gotten through med school in an accelerated seven-yea
r program so he had his doctorate at age 23, and raced through whatever
 licensing hoops were in his way at age 24, and was such a miraculous boon
 to medicine that he'd

 gotten his super high paying job in Alaska

And by then the Hales would have been living with Mrs.
 Cullen.
 I didn't know when Dr.
 and Mrs Cullen had gotten married, so they might not have been living out
 of the doctor's pocketbook until later.
 (But what was Mrs.
 Cullen doing before they married? If she had job skills, they'd never made
 it into the town consciousness.) But that left Dr.
 Cullen eight years racking up the big bucks.
 Not enough time for really high-yield investments to pay out.
 Was he living like a graduate student that entire time, surviving on ramen
 and store samples, only to start living like a king a little later on when
 he'd have to mostly eat savings to do it? When did the other three kids
 come in? If he'd been saving like a Scrooge during this period, why did
 they act so

used

 to their nice things? Alice's story about her boots hadn't held any of

 cost at least two hundred dollars, though she hadn't named a figure.

Edward seemed to be

following

 me to Biology.
 This was a slightly silly impression to have even given everything that
 had happened: we were both starting from the cafeteria, and were both headed
 for the same classroom.
 But he was walking right behind me, and seemed to be matching pace awfully
 precisely with me, Angela, and Mike.
 I couldn't speed up with all the ice on the paths -- so I slowed down,
 claiming to my friends that I felt liable to fall.
 This was entirely credible, as I did fall down a lot even on surfaces not
 encrusted with slippery substances.
 They slowed down with me.

Instead of going around, Edward slowed down too.

We arrived at Biology after what seemed like a very long trip to have squeezed

 Angela and I sat at our table, Mike slid in beside his partner, and Edward

 He hesitated, like he wanted to go on following us -- me -- but instead
 plopped into his chair.
 He held himself very stiffly but didn't turn around to look at me.

Biology progressed in perfect ordinariness.
 Mike and I walked to gym, which ensued with no unusual happenings.
 It wasn't until I walked out of the gym building that Edward Cullen appeared

I jumped, startled.
 My feet came down on the ice and immediately sheered off in opposite directions.
 I went down, scrunching my eyes closed and emitting a squeak.

May I ask why?

Because I'm liable to ask very intrusive personal questions of you if I

 And then, because it would have put the lie to my statement if I'd done
 otherwise, I turned and picked my way across the ice towards the parking

Because there are a number of things about you -- your family in general,

 he wasn't entitled to special rudeness-avoiding care.
