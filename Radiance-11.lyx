\begin_layout Chapter
Soldier
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I first went to Denali, I was five days old.
 I learned to walk in the front hall of the white house that Irina and Laurent
 used to live in, which was used as a guest house for the time I spent there.
 Carmen taught me to hunt for rabbits in the park.
 Eleazar looked at me consideringly and announced that I was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

special
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 David had a jigsaw, and after he convinced Grandma that I couldn't possibly
 cut myself on it, he taught me to make my own puzzles out of doodles on
 cardboard.
 I swiped pastels from Kate's art supply kit to do that, and she chased
 me around the yard without really trying to catch me when she found out.
 Tanya found it amusing to hide small objects -- sometimes my puzzle pieces
 -- around the center house and send me on scavenger hunts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was where my hair got long enough to braid, and where Rosalie first
 pinned it up.
 This was where I spoke my first words, and where Grandpa first answered
 them.
 This was where I read my first book, and Emmett first handed over my bedtime
 story to let me finish it myself.
 This was where I celebrated my first monthly 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

birthday
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and Grandma first lit a candle to mark the occasion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was the one place I'd lived longest.
 Four days in my birthplace Norway, four months 
\emph on
here
\emph default
, a month and a half in Oregon and a month in Michigan, then five years
 in constant motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the three buildings, still familiar, came into view, I should have
 felt like I was coming home.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was partly the company, I decided.
 I was traveling with five people I barely knew, and that would have offset
 the comfort of any place we could have gone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it was also that I didn't 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 a home, unless it was in Mama's arms dashing from place to place.
 A few months at a time was a good chunk of my life, but still not all that
 long, and we'd always been guests in Denali.
 Even though the Alaskan coven lived secluded enough that my growth could
 have been hidden from humans indefinitely, and it would have made some
 sense for me to grow up there, they were only ever 
\emph on
extended
\emph default
 family.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the end of the fourth month, Rosalie and Tanya had started bickering,
 and Eleazar and Grandpa would occasionally have solemn, quiet arguments
 on topics way over my head that lasted for hours and left them both politely
 exasperated.
 Kate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accidentally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 brushed against Emmett while charged up one too many times, Carmen started
 hinting that I might be tired of the scenery and stagnation was not good
 for a growing mind, and soon we were packing our things to end what was
 emphatically just a long 
\emph on
visit
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had cause to be glad, later, that it wasn't home to me.

\begin_layout Standard
David was standing outside in front of the houses to receive us; I recognized
 him from a long way off despite the utter nondistinctiveness of his appearance,
 average in every dimension.
 I flung myself out of Daddy's grip when I saw him and ran over for a hug.
 He looked slightly bemused, but he smiled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, I presume,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, patting my hair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mmhm,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, grinning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good to see you, coppertop.
 You went and got bigger while I wasn't looking,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he accused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he called over my head, and started pointing at unfamiliar faces to confirm
 their identities.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jasper and Edward I recognize.
 Peter? Charlotte? Good to meet you.
 Oh, Alice, Kate wants a private word with you about something.
 She said to tell you she's by the tree you thought looked like a stork.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Private?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Alice uncomfortably, leaning on Jasper, who wrapped her up in his
 arms and didn't look inclined to let her go.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's what she said.
 Also why she's so far away,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 David added, with a nod in Daddy's direction.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know what it's about.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where's everyone else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daddy asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Carmen and Eleazar are hunting -- they wanted to stick it out and be here
 to meet you but they heard some bears coming through and didn't want to
 miss them, it's been all small game for the last few months, run of bad
 luck.
 Tanya's...
 in town, plying her trade,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 David said with a glance down at me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm five and a half, I know what a succubus is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, trying to sound grown-up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you now? Right.
 Tanya's off being succubus-y,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 David said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So I'm Mr.
 Meet-and-greet.
 Alice, are you going to go talk to Kate or not? She seemed to think it
 was important.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice looked up apologetically at Jasper, who leaned over her to kiss her
 on the forehead.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She does realize that I'm probably going to be within five miles of Edward
 again at some point in the future, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd bet on it.
 If I had to guess what it is, she wants to apologize or something -- maybe
 she wrote off a clue about what the Volturi were doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 David suggested, shrugging.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And wants to apologize but doesn't want an audience while she does it? I'm
 just making that up, though.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All right, then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sighed Alice, and she twisted in Jasper's arms to receive his very enthusiastic
 send-off before dancing off between the houses and into the trees.
 Jasper tensed up and looked like he was forcing himself to stand still
 rather than follow her, but Peter clapped him on the shoulder and that
 seemed to help.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy made a grumbling noise.
 I thought that he might be annoyed that Alice had left before telling him
 where to go meet Mama, and he caught my eye and nodded before scowling
 at a perfectly harmless shrub.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Holding up okay, coppertop?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 David asked me, glancing sympathetically between me and Daddy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I heard Tanya talking to your granddad.
 Sounds like you've had a rough week-and-change, huh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded emphatically and hugged David again.
 He chuckled and hugged me back.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Should've dubbed you 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hug-bug
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coppertop
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Were you this snuggly when you were a titchy thing? I guess Rosalie carried
 you practically everywhere you went and you always had your arms 'round
 her neck when you weren't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

talking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to her.
 Hey, do you still do the thing where...?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He patted his face, and I put one hand on his cheek.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This thing?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, that thing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he laughed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Man.
 I know I'm approximately a cousin, is all, and it couldn't have hit me
 as hard as it did your grandad and grandmother and aunt and uncle when
 you disappeared, but I missed you.
 I ever tell you that you reminded me of my niece?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I would've visited, but...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, I know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 David waved off the apology I tried to begin.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's all right.
 It's good you were with your mom.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I smiled sheepishly at him.
 Jasper said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

David, do you have any idea how 
\emph on
long
\emph default
 Kate wants to speak privately with Alice?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Relax, the tree is six miles away, Alice probably isn't even there yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said David affably.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think it'll be that long.
 Sheesh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he added, elbowing me and speaking in an undertone, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vampires with mates, huh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uh-huh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I agreed.
 Although to be perfectly fair to Jasper, he 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 only gotten to be with Alice for a few hours after a separation of several
 years during which he believed she was dead but in fact she was being tortured
 and exploited.
 It was probably sensible for him to be a little clingy.
 Mama would probably be the same way, later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess I'll just have to go around with a blindfold on if I ever want to
 travel without risking it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 David said dramatically, resting the back of his wrist on his scalp as
 he flung the opposite arm out.
 Then he laughed and ushered me into the center house, suggesting that I
 looked like I could use a change of clothes and would probably fit into
 Kate's.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now that you're so tall, you weed, you.
 She won't mind.
 Bet you anything that after their chat she gets Alice to buy her a dozen
 more outfits, as a first step in reconstructing the friendship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I found Kate's room by memory and browsed the closet, humming to myself
 and taking plenty of time.
 I felt more relaxed than I had in days; even on the airplanes, with nothing
 urgent to do, I'd been cramped and bored and anxious.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
David was a little bit different than I remembered him, but he'd been a
 newborn then, still.
 So he'd been all edgy and tended to drop into instinctive behaviors at
 any provocation.
 Even then, he'd been mostly okay around me without other people around.
 I wasn't a threat or food, which meant he didn't have many instincts about
 me and could just have a personality instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some fifteen minutes later, I'd just gotten into a borrowed blouse and a
 pair of Kate's jeans when I heard Daddy yelling my name.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I ran to the nearest room with a window that showed the front yard -- Kate's
 studio, which was just across the hall from her bed-less bedroom -- and
 tried to figure out what was going on.
 I opened the window to hear better what Daddy was saying; I hadn't made
 out anything but 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and a lot of unclear shouting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

- traitors!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daddy was roaring, crouched threateningly towards David, who had his hands
 up and was backing away slowly.
 Daddy jerked his head up to look at me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, get down here, we need to go, 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Peter and Charlotte seemed to be holding Jasper, who was struggling mightily;

What the

 Daddy muttered, and he took off, me still in tow.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, David, you can come, you were an idiot but you didn't betray us on
 purpose.
 Jasper! They won't kill Alice! She's too valuable, but

 Jasper calmed down marginally, and Peter and Charlotte let him go, and
 he caught up to us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We bolted to the Denalis' garage, where David tore the door off rather than
 wait for it to crawl open.
 He grabbed the keys to a station wagon off their hook on the wall.
 I was thrown summarily into the backseat, Jasper on the other side; Charlotte
 and Peter climbed into the cargo area while David took the wheel and Daddy
 rode shotgun.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rosalie modded this for me, back when,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 David muttered, and he gunned the engine and I got to know, for the first
 time, what Mama meant about vampires driving like maniacs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where are we going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Are we going to find Mama -?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can't, we don't know quite where she is and without Alice can't find out,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 David said regretfully.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We've got to go to the airport, head off Carlisle and the others before
 they walk into the trap.

Look, Edward, I realize we weren't great friends even

 you had all your natural affections surgically removed, but there's no
 call for that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said David, hurtling along the highway.
 
\emph on
Yeah,
\emph default
 I thought, and Daddy glanced over his shoulder at me, annoyed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I think we can get to the airport in time to meet them as they land

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And what if their plane is late,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Daddy, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and we waste half an hour letting them catch up? We should look for Bella.
 The only way to protect her now is to get her close to Elspeth, so they
 won't be able to use Alice's power to track her down.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 When he said that, Jasper scooted as far away from me as the confines of
 the car allowed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Demetri is probably still tied up with other witches for now.
 Once we find Bella, we can worry about people they might

not
\emph default
 be actively trying to kill.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I could call the airport, and ask them to give the Cullens a message,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Charlotte proposed, and everyone fell silent in awe of her sheer common
 sense, or at least that was what it looked like to me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Daddy.
 David rattled off the number, and took an exit at Daddy's direction.

How,

Daddy growled in frustration.

Maybe we should turn back; we could at least pare down the wolves, they

Right, it's incomprehensible,

 said Daddy.

The Volturi burned Sasha in front of them, then killed Irina too, and all
 this without raising more than a peep from Kate or Tanya; Eleazar worked

 that they

Wouldn't Kate be worried, and Eleazar...?

 I asked.

Eleazar's basically redundant next to Adelaide herself,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 snorted Daddy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And if they ever decide they really want him back, there's plenty for Chelsea
 to work with there.
 Kate's electricity is touch-based.
 Even as gravel she could keep enough current to be really inconvenient
 to copy, and Adelaide couldn't use the power against witches anyway.
 Both of them are worth more to the Volturi as allies, even partial allies,
 than complete prisoners.

My best guess about where Bella would be by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daddy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I gave her driving directions to Denali years ago.
 She might be using the same route, or part of it, rather than working out
 a new one.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Charlotte hung up on the lady at the airport, who'd agreed to pass on the
 message 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

don't go to Denali, there are wolves around and your law-abiding friends
 won't shoot them; run and call Charlotte instead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when the family's plane landed.
 I thought it was a good way to get the warning across, without giving the
 human messenger enough information to hang herself with.
 I just hoped Grandpa didn't do anything like going into Denali and trying
 to reason with his old friends.
 It would be very much like him.

Edward,

 said Jasper,

did it occur to you that if you bring Elspeth to Bella to protect her from

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Daddy's hands clenched in his lap.

She's already on her way to Denali,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he breathed.

We have to find her first -- Demetri is at least

\begin_layout Standard

They can't use Alice right away either,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jasper, sensibly enough, although there was a crack in his voice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She won't help them; they have to get her to Addy first, and Addy is probably
 helping retrieve witches in whatever order you think they'll use just like
 Demetri is.
 So you're thinking that the wolves will wait at Denali to catch Bella,
 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 they'll be waiting for us at the airport if we decide to go there, 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 they'll be escorting my wife to wherever Addy is so Bella needs Elspeth
 right now? If I were Santiago, I wouldn't trust the Denalis farther than
 I could throw them even now.
 I'd keep all my pet wolves in one place for safety, and stick by my new
 allies to make sure they were clear on who they work for.

 Okay, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said, leaning forward to see around the obstacle in the seat between
 us and fix red eyes on me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here's the thing.
 I'm not a wolf expert, but I did pick up on how serious the imprinting
 stuff is when I heard about the first run-in the family had with them.
 It's not just that whichever wolf is 
\emph on
your

\emph on
None

 of them will, or at least they'll hesitate.

That's not true -- Brady attacked Maureen

 I reached over and showed Jasper the memory of Cody telling me that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jasper watched it, but then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think the kid telling you that story was either exaggerating for dramatic
 effect to impress you, or he misinterpreted whatever the Brady pup was
 trying to do.
 He might have just been trying to knock Maureen over, or startle her.
 Because if he'd actually 
\emph on
hurt
\emph default
 her, him and Maureen's wolf would have had to fight to the death.
 The Volturi have yours.
 They probably want to use him, which entails having 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 around to handle him, and I'm sure all the wolves they've got know what
 you look like now.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We cancel the message to our folks.
 We go back to Denali.
 You go in with us and you

get in the wolves' way
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jasper said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Move quick enough that they can't knock you over without injuring you, and
 they won't be able to stop you.
 Between the five of 
\emph on
us
\emph default
, we can at least hold our own against the other five vampires until our
 backup shows, and that's if they all fight us -- some of them might stand
 down, especially Carmen and Eleazar, maybe Tanya.
 We save Alice, which, incidentally, will let us find 
\emph on
Bella
\emph default
, without this hit-or-miss approximation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he concluded, glancing at Daddy.
 Daddy twitched.

 That will help.
 Yes, if Kate's your concern, we can likely manage her -- she's not a

 can trade off she'll be in manageable bits soon enough.
 Eleazar can barely fight at all.

Charlotte dialed obediently and told the messenger her revision:

careful in Denali, there are wolves around and your law-abiding friends

\begin_layout Standard
He thought he could fight, while Alice was hostage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He couldn't.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of wolves held her, and whenever he tried to throw himself into
 the fray, a claw would pierce or a paw would swipe, and Alice didn't scream,
 but it didn't matter, because the injuries themselves made a metallic 
\emph on
screech
\emph default
 and he would turn his head, every time, to see what had been broken or
 damaged, and try to go to her -- but that would distract him long enough
 for someone else to get a blow in, usually Kate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He thought Eleazar 
\emph on
couldn't
\emph default
 fight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eleazar isn't a 
\emph on
warrior
\emph default

\emph on
vampire
\emph default
, and Allirea isn't, and nobody thought to 
\emph on
stop
\emph default
 Eleazar while he wasn't actively attacking anybody 
\emph on
important
\emph default
.
 She was sabotaged by her own power advertising her presence, and I would
 have thought it was ironic if I'd noticed she was there at the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He thought the wolves couldn't hurt me.

\begin_layout Standard
They

\begin_inset space ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Santiago could.
 She realized what was going on with her wolves (it actually worked quite
 well for half a minute, all of them leaping back when I ran in front of
 them), so she broke my legs and tossed me to a smallish brown wolf with
 a cream belly to be pinned down.
 The wolves who weren't pinning people were in the fight for good after
 that.
 And then it wasn't much of a fight anymore.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't have a good view and I could barely hear, with the wolf's dinner-plate
 paw planted on my ear and forcing my head to the ground, and my legs 
\emph on

\emph default

\emph on
broken
\emph default
 before, I hadn't 
\emph on

\emph default

 It wasn't the instantly healed flare of accidentally biting my tongue a
 little; it wasn't the sudden burst that led to nothingness like when I'd
 been chewing my way out of the net and someone had hit me over the head.
 It hurt and it went on hurting and then after that it 
\emph on
still hurt

 to see a lot through the tears prickling my eyes.
