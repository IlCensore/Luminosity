\begin_layout Standard
When I woke up, the Greenes next door were quiet, although I didn't know
 if they'd resolved their disagreement or just given up and gone to sleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had 
\emph on
known
\emph default
 -- I 
\emph on
had known
\emph default
 and simply not thought twice about it -- that the imprints who'd lived
 in the village all along were not staying with their wolves out of unadulterate
d affection.
 Amanda had been a Canadian tourist, basically kidnapped off the street
 when Albert gaped at her.
 She'd been brain-scrambled so she'd stay with him regardless of whatever
 else she'd had in mind for her life, so he'd remain a functional member
 of the Volturi guard dogs.
 And then I'd run around heedlessly through the village deprogramming everybody
 in an indiscriminate wave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I knew Amanda wouldn't miss her relatives and friends -- I couldn't do anything
 about that half of Chelsea's work -- but she might miss 
\emph on
Canada
\emph default
, or...
 what had she been doing with herself, before, anyway? Aro had never read
 Amanda.
 She might have been in college or had a career or, for all I knew, another
 family of her own, another child or three back home, another husband.
 She didn't talk about where she'd come from beyond 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Canada"; I didn't even know what province.
 She'd handled dropping out of her old life on her own once she was warped
 into wanting to, well enough that no one had made trouble looking for her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unless she was from Vancouver, Amanda was going to be the only imprint who
 wasn't at least somewhat close to home when the packs went their separate
 ways, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I sat in bed and put my chin on my knees.
 I wondered what would happen if she wanted to leave.
 Would she want to take the baby? Her daughter was a puppy, not a normal
 human child.
 Eve wouldn't start demonstrating any unusual properties until she was twelve
 or thirteen at least, and might or might not activate even then -- I didn't
 know if vampire presences early in her life would cause automatic floofing
 later if she didn't meet any more vampires growing up.
 But it might take longer than that for it to be considered acceptable for
 wolves to live wherever they wanted.
 And even if Amanda felt nothing real for 
\emph on
Albert
\emph default
 anymore, at least 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 of her affection for their daughter had to be real...
 probably...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I left my bedroom and found Embry and Gwyn, still up as my night shift guards,
 sitting in the suite's front room hushedly playing cards.
 I'd just about forgotten they were there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Morning,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whispered Gwyn when she saw I was up.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Want to play?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I wanted to go anywhere out of the suite, they'd have to put their game
 down in the middle (I wondered if my mom had this sort of conundrum with
 Renata? Probably not; Renata never did anything interesting) so I sat with
 them and took some cards from the deck and lost to Embry at Go Fish, then
 went with them to the cafeteria so they could have dinner and I could have
 breakfast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I heard Albert and Amanda fighting last night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I blurted, between finishing my bacon and starting my eggs.
 The cafeteria was temporarily open all day and night, as people were keeping
 irregular hours and attempting to preemptively change time zones for the
 upcoming move to La Push.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Fighting?
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Gwyn and Embry in unison.
 They'd both been in Rachel's pack, with Albert, and would know him pretty
 well, and Amanda through him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, as much as an imprint can fight with her wolf,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I allowed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't catch the words.
 I -- I think it's my fault because I deprogrammed Amanda with everybody
 else

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, Elspeth, sweetie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Gwyn, patting my hand.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, you did a good thing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I'd gone slower, I could have been more careful and only undone the stuff
 tying you guys to the 
\emph on
Volturi
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You didn't take away anything that was really there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Gwyn.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Like, I'm still glad Santiago gave us dance lessons, aren't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, but...
 But I took away what Amanda and Albert had,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And even if it wasn't real, it can hurt them for it to be gone.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I suspected Albert was in worse straits, since any discomfort in Amanda
 would upset him too and he'd also have to deal with the situation itself,
 but Amanda was probably none too thrilled either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gwyn and Embry fell sympathetically silent.
 I finished my food, and Embry yawned.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About time for the shift change,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jake and...
 not Grace again, who was it...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Laurel,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 supplied Gwyn.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure if we're supposed to go get her ourselves or what.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can go wait for Jake to wake up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and we returned to the suite and the deck of cards and Gwyn demonstrate
d to us both that War had a non-trivial skill element until my wolf finally
 padded out of his bedroom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Morning, Elsie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Gwyn, you're relieved; go wake up Laurel if she's not already up and tell
 her I said to come here and relieve Embry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You got it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Gwyn, hopping to her feet and dashing off to do what she was told.
 When Gwyn ran it was one of the few times she looked remotely thirteen
 years old -- she pulled off the older look that came with wolf activation
 in stillness or when she moved slowly or danced, but she ran like a kid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It weirded me out, just a little, to watch my Jake giving orders.
 I'd seen him do it a few times, but he'd done most of his interacting with
 the pack in wolf form where the details were opaque to me and it might
 as well have been anyone else in charge.
 And a good chunk of the time we'd spent together hadn't involved any other
 wolves at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake plunked down into the chair Gwyn had been using.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's on the agenda for the day?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uh, another blast victim's family is coming in to hear what happened to
 their relative, so I'm going to that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's at three this afternoon.
 I don't have anything else planned.
 I guess we could hang out here, or wander around the compound looting,
 or whatever.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You didn't seem interested in looting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not accustomed to having lots of possessions.
 I spent most of my life constantly running around North America with what
 my mom could carry in a backpack...
 she can carry a lot, but was limited by the volume of the backpack...
 and I don't really feel like loading up on stuff just because there's stuff
 lying around.
 If I want some object later I'm pretty sure I'll be able to get it, you
 know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And behold, consumerism lies gurgling in a ditch somewhere,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Embry, gesturing like he was making a toast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shrugged.
 It wasn't a statement about my values, just about my inclinations.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't mind if other people want stuff.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Laurel knocked perfunctorily and let herself into the suite, waving Embry
 out, and Embry gave Jake a half-serious salute and left to go to bed.
 Laurel saluted too, more seriously, and sat with us.
 Her posture was ridiculously good.
 It made me feel like I was scrunched up in a little ball.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a silence, and I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We could go see what my mom is doing.
 She might be drawing up a vampire org chart.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will there be vampire cubicles and vampire stock options too?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Jake, chuckling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vampire palaces and vampire cornering-the-stock-market-through-leverage-and-psyc
hic-powers, I think is more the idea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, getting up.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's looting and then there's suddenly seizing all the finances of an
 absurdly rich reigning oligarchy.
 I think my mom skipped the first thing in favor of the second.
 So probably not too many vampire cubicles.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think I'll angle for a vampire corner office,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jake.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll get my name on a little copper insert on the door in a vampire font
 and delegate paperwork to my vampire secretary.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I giggled, and Jake said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, this means that conspiracy theorists who think the world is secretly
 controlled by vampires are 
\emph on
right
\emph default
, or will be once your mom lays down some more infrastructure, anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think those conspiracy theories are mostly about lizard people,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, I guess you're right.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He paused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do lizard people exist?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not as far as I know.

\begin_layout Standard
We walked to the compound, and found my mom in the throne room talking to
 Siobhan, whose eyes were a striking rose-gold.
 I wasn't sure when she'd last eaten a human, but it was apparently recent
 enough that the one animal meal she'd agreed to eat hadn't displaced her
 eye color completely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

...

\end_inset

in Ireland?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mom was saying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, I suppose we don't 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to live there full time, as long as it's up to me who 
\emph on
does
\emph default
.
 Maggie and Gianna are fine.
 Molly will probably be fine, when she's old enough to turn.
 I think Cath and Ilario are planning to live in England but I don't mind
 if they visit my island.
 Everyone else who can bite through a phone book who wants to set foot on
 that island, I want them to have to clear it with me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think the governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom
 might have something to say about your territoriality when we let on that
 we exist,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mom said dryly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not trying to regulate 
\emph on
human
\emph default
 immigration,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan sourly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't care where humans go.
 Especially now that I'm not even going to 
\emph on
eat
\emph default
 them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She shook her head, a disgusted look on her face.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You gambled smart, but it's a 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 narrow win in favor of animal blood, Bella.
 It is 
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mom smiled thinly at that.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's your choice...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, I know, I'm just griping to gripe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sighed Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Have you considered that, in addition to having several capitals, you could
 have several arms of your organization in different places? You could put
 a base in Ireland somewhere and I could work out of there regardless of
 where and whether you move.
 I don't need to be physically present to make plans for people.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I suppose,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mom mused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wanted to get Stefan and Vladimir to handle the physical combat training
 anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're better choices.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm still calling you General, though,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mom said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ugh.
 Put it on official documents if you must.
 Don't 
\emph on
call
\emph default
 me that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan looked up at me and Jake and Laurel.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Call 
\emph on

\emph default
 that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Jacob comes with a title -- `Alpha' -- and we can just put an `Imperial'
 before it to distinguish him from his sisters,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said my mom.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But fine, I'll call you Siobhan in casual conversation and reserve `General'
 for other situations.
 Elspeth, sweetie, what's up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just wanted to see what was going on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you have an org chart?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About half of one, and not written down,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you feel about going into the 
\noun on
prpr
\noun default
 department? You don't have to -- you're five, and also a princess, and
 do not have to work if you don't want to -- but it's open to you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What does 
\noun on
prpr
\noun default
 stand for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stands for Public Relations, and `Public Relations',
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, making air quotes around the second instance of the phrase, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where Public Relations means more or less what you've been doing already
 in helping with the blast victims -- telling people who need explanations
 what's what, answering questions, generally interacting with humans for
 whatever purposes come up.
 We'll have pamphlets eventually, no doubt, but I imagine having someone
 to talk to would help.
 And `Public Relations' means turning folks into vampires, but that's only
 part of the same department because the one will funnel into the other.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sounds fine to me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does she get an extra title?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Jake asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Beyond princess, I mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Imperial Soothsayer?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mom suggested.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I suppose it's historically been used to refer to fortune-telling, which
 is more Alice's job, but it breaks down into `truth teller', so it seems
 appropriate for you anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake snickered and patted me on the head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm glad you're having fun, Bella, but you could be a 
\emph on
little

 more restrained about the titles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I already said I wouldn't address you as yours when it's not called for,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, smiling, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

so you needn't worry.
 They're just for fun, and to give us an edge in commanding respect for
 something other than being able to dismember humans when we need to deal
 with them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You think calling Elspeth the Imperial Soothsayer will do that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think it may if we all pretend to take each other very seriously while
 we call her that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mom replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If we allow ourselves to act like vampires instead of passing for human,
 in front of humans, we're going to come across as quite strange.
 We move differently, talk differently, look different, think differently,
 live differently.
 We may as well come across as strange and 
\emph on
grand
\emph default
 instead of strange and 
\emph on
frightening
\emph default
 or strange and 
\emph on
inconsequential
\emph default
.
 If I find that, in practice, calling ourselves Imperial Whatevers backfires,
 I will tone it down.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She gestured at my dad as she said that, indicating that she did have a
 very good way to determine if the nomenclature was meeting with a suitable
 reaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fair enough,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you going to build a base in Ireland?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perhaps.
 Or you could just get a house with Liam -- or go on being vagrants, I suppose,
 if you prefer that even now that you've moved to vegetarianism -- and telecommu
te all the time.
 I was thinking one capital in Europe, 
\emph on
maybe
\emph default
 two since it's so densely populated, and I'm tempted to put one in Norway
 for personal reasons, and the possible second in Greece for geographical
 coverage.

There are some, but it's just not an area that will need that much management.
 So I think I'll put one in India somewhere, one in Russia, one in Australia,
 two in Africa above and below the equator exact countries to be determined,
 one in Brazil, one in QuÃ©bec, one in Florida, and one in Washington State,
 although I may adjust those last two if my parents don't have a long-term
 interest in living where they currently do.
 I figure that installs me at least vaguely near most of the vampire populations
 of the world as they currently stand.

 He can pop over and deal with emergencies that the sort of staffperson

There are tradeoffs, of course -- but not-entirely-vampires can eat plants,
 reproduce unaided, and are still immortal and have arbitrary amounts of
 mental storage space.
 The only reason I'm hoping to turn more people into vampires at all is
 that as far as we know, one has to be

No.
 In fact, consider it an imperial mandate that you not make me a grandmother

 But it means that one of the fast tracks to getting turned, for people
 who want it, will be volunteering to carry a half-vampire baby for someone
 who wants one, and that it will be customary to strongly encourage female

 We'll probably need to set up one of our own, of those.

 Addy was in

One of them was married.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

One,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said,

is that we could use memories taken from all of you, and 
\emph on
attempt

 to use them to remind your brothers who they're supposed to be.
 This won't bring back their own perspectives on any memories you have of
 them, and it won't recover any information that was private to them, but
 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 it worked they'd know who you were again, and might fall into roles similar
 to the ones they used to occupy.
 The reason it might not work is that you're all humans, and human memories
 don't stick as strongly or vividly.
 They both contain some vampire memories that might be impossible to move
 out of the way like that.

More likely to work,

 I said,

but you wouldn't like the results as much.
 Two of the other people who this happened to looked in mirrors and recognized
 themselves as being similar-looking vampires.
 That let them fixate on those vampires' memories and get the extra information
 out of the way.
 Effectively, they now 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 those people, in different bodies.
 Your brothers didn't do that naturally, but it's possible that by making
 them look physically different with makeup and dye and such, or by re-blasting
 a smaller period of a specific vampire's lifetime, we could get them to
 `wake up' -- as someone else.
