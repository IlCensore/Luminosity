So do I call you `Princess Elspeth' now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake asked, elbowing me in the ribs as we went down the stairs towards
 the tunnel to the village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My mother might not wind up calling herself `queen'.
 And there are fiddly technical details about who's a princess and who isn't,
 in various systems of nobility, so I might not count even if she does.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She rules the world now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She can declare you a princess if she wants.
 And invent her own monarchy to technically make you one if she has to.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, we beat the Volturi,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said slowly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but it remains to be seen if she can hold on to the power...
 especially since she's not likely to be popular with vampires who want
 to go on eating people, and won't have access to Chelsea's power forever.
 Maybe even some of the people who helped us in the rebellion wouldn't like
 the idea of her being queen when they think about it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake dropped an arm around my shoulders and pulled me a little closer.
 We reached the mouth of the tunnel and started along it.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That might put you in danger, if people are trying to get at her...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's probably one of the billion things she's trying to figure out now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure if I dare go to sleep,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, only half-joking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tonight will probably be safe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I opined.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll be in the village overnight and someone would notice and make a fuss
 if a random vampire tried to come in, and word won't have gotten out everywhere
 for a while.
 Tomorrow my mother will probably have an idea about how to deal with the
 problem.
 And we're not going to be out of my father's range.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We got to the border of the village.
 Leah and Collin were both standing watch, in wolf form -- representatives
 of Rachel's pack and Becky's respectively, to propagate information instantly
 through the population if something happened.
 They didn't growl at us, but they didn't stand aside, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi, Leah, Collin, and whoever else is listening,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, vaguely sheepish.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Um, we won.
 Can we come in so I can tell everybody about it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rachel, in uniform, appeared between the two wolves a moment later; Becky
 turned up shortly after her sister.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Rachel asked, raising an eyebrow, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elaborate at all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure, um,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and I hit both alpha women with a quickly improvised summary, on the theory
 that they were both adults and, outside of wolf form, wouldn't telepathically
 leak anything to the younger wolves.
 Leah and Collin made mildly puzzled faces, presumably about being left
 out, but didn't otherwise react.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your room is still open,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Rachel after a couple of minutes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're going to be out for the day soon, aren't you? You can crash there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We need to decide what to do next,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Becky murmured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rachel nodded, once, and gave Jake an appraising look.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We all do.

\begin_layout Standard
Jake tucked me into my old bed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Won't be able to catch a front row seat to Elspeth's Brain Theater tonight,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he sighed, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

have to go wolf to telepathically confer with the extended relations about
 everything, but I can stay here by you in case something does happen.
 I'll be up all night anyway, most likely.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I yawned, and I relaxed, burrowing into my pillow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next morning, Jake was still sitting by my bed, still awake (if slightly
 droopy) and still wolf-shaped.
 He was making faces, insofar as he was able, reacting to the conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can I get caught up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 Jake nodded, but instead of shifting to explain what was going on to me,
 he got to his feet and led me through the village to the assembly room.
 Many of the wolves were there, although some of the younger ones and all
 of the imprinted men were absent.
 Also in attendance were both of my parents.
 My father appeared to be feeding my mother a rapid-fire summary of everything
 the wolves thought so she could follow what was going on, in place of a
 cumbersome mechanism where the wolves phased and unphased to think together
 and communicate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So what'd I miss?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, going up to my mother and father.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Almost nothing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, manifestly frustrated.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We've got more factions here than we have feasible packs, and one thing
 they can mostly agree on is that packs should stick together...
 so the opportunity to split up is limited.
 At about two a.m.
 we narrowed it down to four different things people wanted to do, and Leah
 had the reasonably clever idea of trying to turn Embry into a fourth pack
 leader since one of the three likely candidates for his unidentified father
 was Billy Black, which would 
\emph on
presumably
\emph default
 mean he could be an alpha like Rachel, Becky, and Jacob, but it didn't
 work.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are the four groups?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A bunch of them want to stay here, minus the military operations,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, ticking off a finger.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd be willing to maintain their budget as reparations, and I don't have
 anything else in mind for the village structure, so that would be fine
 with me.
 A bunch of them want to go to La Push and rebuild the old Quileute town.
 Potential legal awkwardness, but also fine; we can co-opt the contacts
 the Volturi had to make things go smoothly with human authorities, and
 I intend to start peeling back the masquerade in general.
 A few of them have a taste for beating up `bad vampires' and want to be
 a branch of my military, wherever I wind up installing myself.
 I'm not going to complain about that.
 And a few of them want to travel the world, sort of like Jacob's pack was
 doing before, which is...
 problematic, without Pera accompanying them, without routine larceny, and
 considering how much I expect to rely on Alice.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, you're queen of the world; can't you just say that the first three
 things are fine and one alpha can take a pack to do each of them and ban
 the last one?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Actually, I decided to call myself Empress Regnant, in a fit of self-indulgence,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And I'm contemplating a gold-based theme for the rest of the necessary terminolo
gy -- you know, because of the eyes.
 Golden Coven, Gold Empire, etcetera.
 Anyway.
 I don't want to push the wolves around like that until I'm confident we
 can't find a consensus of some kind.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are the alphas thinking?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Becky thinks I should rule out of Volterra, so a single pack can cover the
 ones who want to work for me and the ones who just want to live here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and thinks that this single pack should be Jake's, so she and anyone else
 who wants to join her can go to La Push.
 The trouble with that is that I'm not enthusiastic about ruling from Volterra,
 although I'll cave on that if I need to.
 Rachel's personally inclined towards wandering the earth but is willing
 to head a pack anywhere necessary if we can just work out what they're
 all supposed to do.
 Jake wants to stick with you, and I'd like to keep you close by us unless
 you have some overwhelming objection.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't, I guess,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, putting a hand on Jake's shoulder.
 My hand sank into rusty brown fur halfway up my forearm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's probably safer.
 Who besides Rachel wants to wander the earth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 My father listed a handful of wolves, all unimprinted.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What exactly do they want to 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 while wandering the earth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have the same question,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother muttered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not interested in funding something that inconvenient.
 They have no plans for supporting themselves if they want anything they
 can't hunt for, let alone plans for remaining inconspicuous in accordance
 with a 
\emph on
gradual, non-panic-inducing
\emph default
 demystification of the supernatural to the general population.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is Pera going to help you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, an idea forming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jasper calmed her down enough to let her consider the idea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

after Addy...
 helped...
 him and Alice and your daddy with Chelsea's power.
 She'll work for me, but she doesn't want to interact with me directly any
 more than she has to.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy copied Chelsea's power? Does that mean she was done with Alec's?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It means that we've got Alec working for us, although Addy did need to snip
 him away from Jane, and now he's anesthetizing the remaining bits and pieces
 while I'm here so Addy's freed up to do other things,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, not making eye contact.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyway, yes, Pera's helping, is willing to at least attempt vegetarianism,
 and can be deployed but is not to be invited over for the Christmas party.
 What's your idea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you're going to need to start enforcing the vegetarianism thing.
 You can get the news out by just having Dwi, or Addy borrowing his power,
 tell everyone we're collectively aware of that there's a new regime in
 town, and wait for it to spread by word of mouth.
 But that doesn't handle 
\emph on
enforcement
\emph default
.
 Pera could hide the wolves and travel with them, and they could back her
 up and scout and stuff looking for anybody breaking the rules while they
 run around, but they wouldn't have to actually be military-ish because
 Pera can take apart anybody she wants all by herself.
 You could pay them to do that, and Pera wouldn't have to be around you
 and they'd get to travel inconspicuously and with economic support.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother tilted her head thoughtfully.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's an option.
 The problem is that I was hoping to keep Pera local to wherever we wind
 up so she can hide people I need to sentence to prolonged imprisonment
 but don't want to kill.
 Or my justice department sentences to prolonged imprisonment.
 I haven't decided yet how I'm going to organize internal affairs.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The cohort that wants to travel isn't particularly interested in doing enforceme
nt even on that level, anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my father said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother chewed on her lip a little, then shook her head.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This hasn't gone anywhere significant in the last several hours, I imagine
 the wolves are all very tired from their all-nighter, and I've got more
 Volturi to sort through and an administration to organize.
 Let's pick up here in, say, ten hours after you guys are all caught up
 on sleep?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She gestured expansively at the groggy wolves.
 Rachel and Becky both nodded, and the packs dispersed.
 Jake nudged me affectionately in the back with his forehead, then trotted
 off himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Want to come witness the historical moment?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked me, and I shrugged and followed her and my father out of
 the village.

\begin_layout Standard
Alec was in the throne room, sitting on the chair that used to belong to
 Caius.
 Every now and then he turned his gaze from his still-dismantled former
 covenmates to the throne, as though to confirm that he was really sitting
 in Caius's chair, but he always returned his attention to maintaining the
 knockout aura over the prisoners a moment later.
 His eyes had gone gold -- Addy must have made another trip in to bring
 animals overnight -- but otherwise he looked like I remembered, albeit
 having sustained some hair damage.
 Deceptively youthful, a distant and neutral expression on his face, very
 like a calmer and thinner-lipped Jane.
 I skirted the cluster of pieces to avoid falling in myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said to Alec, helping myself to Athenodora's chair.

How are you doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I guess I'm okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said in a low voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Really?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 My mother walked into the middle of his affected area, unhindered, and
 picked up a piece of someone, which she brought over to Addy and poked
 her with before tossing it back where it had come from.
 I thought it was probably Dwi, whose power would let Addy carry on bidirectiona
lly telepathic conversations with the remnants of the Volturi to determine
 who could and could not be salvaged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I guess,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

How did my mother convince you to work for her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked.
\end_layout

What else would I do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Alec said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What do you mean? Whatever else, as long as it didn't involve killing people,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I said no when she asked me to work for her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alec said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maybe she'd let me go -- maybe, if I convinced her and her mate I would
 eat animals and not make trouble -- but someone else would recognize me
 eventually and want to hurt me.
 I was almost as feared as Jane.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

He shook his head, keeping his eyes fixed on his old covenmates.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jane was fast with her power.
 I'm not fast.
 A coven coming from several directions could get me if I were on my own.
 Or one person who was quick enough or good enough at hiding or had a power
 that could get around or through mine.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He glanced my way.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And I don't think your mom -- I mean, um, Her Imperial Majesty? I'm not
 sure what I'm supposed to call her...
 I don't think she'd want to send me out to go off independently with covenmates
 who could keep me safe.
 I'd be a threat that way.
 She might look the other way if those Romanians wanted me dead, or something.
 If I work for her she'll keep me safe.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Oh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

And even if nobody would want to hurt me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said,

 I never have been.

Her,

 he agreed,

 The whole coven.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Some of them will probably help us, like you,

And you can make new friends too.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Probably,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 He sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I let Addy make me not miss Jane.
 I got the option.
 It was...
 easier, I guess, and missing her wouldn't bring her back, and if I want
 Her Imperial Majesty to trust me it was probably the safe bet...
 But I miss missing her.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm not sure I understand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I could think of possibly-similar cases to compare against, but it would
 be faster to let him explain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure I do either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He pursed his lips, then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think I know how not to be a twin.
 A non-dominant twin.
 I don't know what to do with myself if not follow Jane around and help
 her and make her happy.

\begin_layout Standard
I had the oddest temptation to ruffle his hair -- he still had most of it,
 and there was plenty to ruffle -- but I refrained; I knew he didn't like
 people other than Jane to touch him.
 (I wondered how long that would last without Jane around.) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Maybe you'll find a mate soon, or something,

 I suggested.
\end_layout

I don't think so,

Imperial Highness would be the style, but you don't have to go by it if

 my mother replied.

A few of them went out and about overnight but they're all back now.
 The ones who haven't eaten their first animals yet are still not pleased
 about the close quarters.
 Alistair will probably return home soon to get away from all the people,
 and I expect to shed most of the other Brits that way too -- they're not
 as close to the core group.
 I'm not yet sure who all will stick around as part of the new administration
 beyond that.

Also, I'm not sure if you should go wandering around Volterra by yourself.

I could bring Cody,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The point isn't company, it's safety, and Cody's less useful in a fight

 That said, everyone who might attack you while we've got everything buttoned
 up here hasn't been blasted yet, since the former Volturi aren't going
 anywhere and I'm keeping an eye on Addy.
 And if we do lose control of things here somehow it would be better for
 you to be out of harm's way anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 She bit her lip and looked at me, scrutinizing.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Take your phone, check in every half an hour or so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said,

 If they don't let you in, come back and we'll try something more elaborate

Addy hadn't told me exactly where the blast victims were, but there was

The receptionist blinked at me, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let me call down Dr.
 Valenti.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I talked my way past Dr.
 Valenti, too, who let me into the room where they were keeping the six
 blast victims during the day and stood in the doorway to supervise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were four men and two women, and while they all seemed physically fine,
 no two of them were speaking the same language, and most of them didn't
 seem aware of their surroundings, instead slouching in their respective
 chairs and reciting the inner monologues of vampires (only vampires, no
 humans -- I wondered why) read long ago.
 The two who were awake enough to notice my entrance were one of the men
 -- who started shouting angrily in Old English, using mannerisms that I
 identified as belonging to a long-dead vampire named John killed six years
 after his creation for turning an immortal child.
 They even looked alike.
 Also apparently lucid was one of the women, who didn't speak at all, but
 looked at me with troubled, dark eyes.
 She looked familiar too, but then, nearly everyone did, with all the different
 faces I remembered to compare to.
 Since she wasn't talking, I turned to the other

 patient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hello,

 Dr.

I was telling that bastard Aro to stay the hell away from Anne,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said, referring to the immortal child the vampire he thought he was
 had been executed for turning -- his actual daughter, who'd been dying
 of the flu at age nine when he bit her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then I was in some kind of delirious stupor for -- I don't know how long;
 I can't count time normally anymore -- but some kind of stupor, several
 days at least, but then I looked in a mirror here and remembered who I
 was and noticed I'd been turned human!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

So you were confused about who you were until you looked in a mirror?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked slowly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Yes, I was.
 As though I could have been any of a thousand people, but had to check.
 But it was obvious once I saw.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked at him.
 He didn't look 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 like John, even exactly like John had been as a human.
 His hair was different -- John had worn it long -- and he had better teeth
 (although not as good as a vampire's teeth), and his skin was a shade darker.
 But the facial features were close enough that I could imagine that a mind
 with no idea who it was would latch onto the identity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I could think of half a dozen other people Aro had read who looked at
 least as much like the man in front of me as John had.
 Five humans, and one vampire who'd been read at the age of a hundred and
 was -- as far as I knew -- still alive.
 I wasn't sure what would make John's memories be the ones to stick, while
 the human memories and the other vampire's didn't.

 Anne had died in 1754, one of the immortal children Aro had kept around
