Teacher

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't have any luck with sending along all the witchy sensations the
 next day, either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Maybe,
\emph default
 I said after an hour of trying, 
\emph on
you should send me another memory of Chelsea's.
 All the relationships felt different and maybe with more to draw on I could
 figure out what the common features are, and maybe that would work better.

\emph default
 It was a transparent attempt at varying the exercises.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Hmm,
\emph default
 said Addy, raising an eyebrow at me.
 
\emph on
No, I doubt that will help.
 Perhaps it's something to try later, when we run out of low-hanging fruit.
 Try it again -- compose the sensations into one of the hypotheticals, and
 then try to subtract the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hypothetical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tag, it reduces the impact too much.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I'm sick of this, I've been doing it for the past hour,
\emph default
 I complained.
 I didn't like making progress, at least not quickly, but I didn't like
 being bored, much, either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy tilted her head.
 
\emph on
And you'd rather be doing something else?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Yeah.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Well,
\emph default
 Addy replied, smiling thinly, 
\emph on
there is another idea for how you could develop your power into a weapon
 which will probably be easier to arrange.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Yes, this will break up the monotony for you nicely,
\emph default
 said Addy, and suddenly I didn't like the sound of her mental voice one
 bit.
 
\emph on
Do you remember how I said your power was similar to Jane's?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I twitched away from her outstretched hand.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, nonono,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll try again with the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But you were so bored,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And don't say you won't complain again; I really can tell, whether you say
 it or not.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It will be easy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said pleasantly.
 She extended her hand again, tapped me on the nose.
 
\emph on
All you have to do is find Jane, mildly annoy her, spend perhaps a second
 or two acquiring your ammunition, and poof.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Please, please, no,
\emph default
 I begged her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Look on the bright side.
 The only way I get to find out whether this works is if you successfully
 try it on 
\emph default
me
\emph on
, you know,
\emph default
 she responded.
 
\emph on
Now, Elspeth, either you may go and find Jane yourself, and provoke her
 only as much as you must in order to get a reaction from her that lasts
 a few moments, or 
\emph default
I
\emph on
 can go find her, and pat her on the head and come back and make sure it
 
\emph default
really
\emph on
 sinks in.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Do I have to actually annoy her, or could I maybe just ask -
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy laughed aloud.
 
\emph on
I suppose you could ask, and she'd probably oblige you.
 Aro did that once, just out of curiosity.
 Just the once.
 But that would be a rather suspicious request to make of her, don't you
 think? You haven't spoken to her before, so it isn't a matter of learning
 more about your close personal friend Jane.
 And the story of your childish reaction to your injury in Alaska -- oh,
 don't look at me that way, Elspeth, you're five years old and permitted
 occasional childishness -- has made the rounds throughout the guard, so
 I doubt Jane will believe you're deliberately seeking out her unique experienti
al offerings on their own merits.
 No, I recommend that you simply walk into her room without knocking.
 That should do the trick.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shivered.
 
\emph on
What if she wants to know why I'm there?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Tell her I sent you to fetch her for me, if she bothers to ask.
 If she comes to ask me what's going on, I can replace your power with hers
 and then tell all sorts of lies, and then you can go home for the day and
 recover.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I leaned away from her hand again, and paused to think.
 Addy allowed me fifteen seconds in which I came up with nothing, and then
 she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go on, then.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, Addy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured, and I got to my feet and went to Jane's room.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I knew the layout of the entire compound; there was a map on the wall of
 the lounge in West.
 I'd been there long enough to memorize it during Esta's baby shower.
 So I had no excuse for taking forever to find Jane's room, and Addy knew
 it.
 I walked, slowly but steadily, down the flight of stairs and down the hall.
 I took a right, and the first door on the right was hers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had to have heard me coming -- at least if she was 
\emph on
in
\emph default
 her room, which she might not be.
 If she wasn't, maybe Addy would let me put this off or skip it altogether.
 I opened the door.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I saw a pair of brilliant burgundy eyes and then all I could do was scream.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might really have been only a second or two.
 I couldn't tell.
 I was 
\emph on
burning
\emph default
, I was not meant to 
\emph on
hold
\emph default
 that much pain, and that was all there was, wherever I tried to fling myself
 and escape there was only more fire, I knew I was screaming but couldn't
 even hear it over the anguish pouring over me like liquid iron.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jane blinked, and it stopped.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was on the floor, limbs sprawled crazily as though I'd been seizing, looking
 upside-down at Jane's angelic, calm expression, which made her seem as
 though she not only bore no responsibility for the torture but was also
 politely puzzled about why I had been making so much noise in the first
 place.
 Her dark blonde hair dangled above my face as she leaned over me.
 She looked so young -- she looked younger than 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 -- and so innocent.
 Like a porcelain doll.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Knock,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I successfully interpreted the word, agreed with the instruction enthusiasticall
y, and nodded my head rapidly several times.
 Jane reached out, seized the neck of my shirt, and picked me up and set
 me on my feet with one hand.
 I wobbled but didn't fall.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jane's room was decorated mostly in warm colors.
 She had carpet that matched her eyes, a lot of knicknacks made of gold,
 a cherry wood wardrobe, and pale orange upholstery on her sofa set.
 This made her slight figure, dressed in the black cloak of the Volturi,
 stand out like a blot of ink against the bright background.
 She looked at me expectantly from under her hood.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied.
 I had a brain somewhere but seemed to have misplaced it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are you doing here? What do you want?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Um-um-um-Addysentme,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, finding it exceptionally urgent that Jane get what she wanted without
 delay.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And she didn't tell you to knock?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Jane, skeptical.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, she didn't.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I reached for the wall to steady myself.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
 I'm so sorry.
 I will never ever ever walk in without knocking again.
 I'm so sorry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jane nodded to herself.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I suppose I shall go see what Addy wants.
 You run along.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I bolted.
 Behind me, I heard Jane chuckling softly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went straight home, unaccompanied.
 Seth and Karen, guarding the tunnel, stopped me, and I told them that Addy
 told me to go home.
 This was only a slight stretching of the truth -- she 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 said I should go home and recover, it was just that she hadn't quite specified
 whether I had to check in with her first.
 I forced myself to interpret her instructions as permitting me to flee
 home to Jake without her escort, and managed to convince the wolves to
 the point where they let me lurch past Karen without trying to catch me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I got to my door, I almost knocked.
 It took me three seconds of focusing very hard on my breathing and the
 fact that this room was 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 Jane's before I managed to turn the handle without foolishly rapping my
 knuckles against the wood.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake wasn't home yet.
 I slumped into the armchair and closed my eyes, hoping that my internal
 clock would spontaneously rejigger itself to let me sleep instead of being
 so miserably conscious.
 Of course no such thing happened.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why did Jane 
\emph on
exist
\emph default
? Could she perhaps be made to stop existing? How much of a chance would
 Jake have at killing her before she or someone else tore him apart, if
 I asked him to? Would he go, or was Chelsea thorough enough that he'd find
 a reason not to hurt one of Our Friends? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of seconds later, the fact that I cared about Jake reasserted itself,
 and I decided that I should probably not send him into a nest of evil vampires
 who only slightly valued his life and tell him that one of them tortured
 me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went into our bathroom and looked in the mirror.
 There was a wild look in my eyes and my hair was mussed, but I didn't otherwise
 appear hurt.
 I combed my hair, and braided pigtails into it for good measure, and then
 went and flopped on my bed to try to relax.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Jake walked in, I had my face buried in my pillow and couldn't see
 him, but I heard him open the door well enough.
 I startled badly enough to accidentally fling myself off my covers and
 onto the floor.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He walked up and helped me off the ground, hugging me in greeting as long
 as he was there.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't usually roll off of the furniture in excitement when I walk into
 a room.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eep,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I squeaked.
 I wasn't fine, he'd smell a lie a mile away if I told him I was fine, but
 he had to 
\emph on
believe
\emph default
 I was fine, I would be so completely lost without Jake if they took him
 away and that meant he had to think I was okay because if he thought otherwise
 it would only make me 
\emph on
less
\emph default
 okay.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake put his hands on my shoulders and pushed me back a few inches to get
 a good look at my face.
 I tried to look normal, but my lip trembled and there was a little too
 much moisture in my eyes.
 An expression of severity and displeasure took over his face.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elsie, what happened?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I flung myself forward to go back to the hugging part, which involved less
 scrutiny and more warmth, but he just repeated the pushing gesture and
 stared into my eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elsie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm -- I'm going out of my mind just a tiny bit wondering what's gotten
 you so jumpy and sad all the time.
 You dream like you need to be on Prozac and you look like you're afraid
 of your shadow and you won't tell me anything, and -- and geez, Elsie,
 I'm here for 
\emph on
you
\emph default
, that is the 
\emph on
point
\emph default
 of there being a Jacob Black in the world is for

I can't,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I sniffled.

I can't.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He let go of my shoulders and I pitched forward again to be held; Jake
 started swaying back and forth.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shh-shh-shh.
 You don't have to be sorry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A heavy sigh blew past his clenched teeth.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can I have a 
\emph on
hint
\emph default

 you don't have to, you don't have to do anything you don't want to, but

Sometimes...
 the stuff Addy wants me to work on...
 is hard,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I choked.
 He waited patiently for me to go on, and I collected myself for a couple
 of minutes, but couldn't think of anything else true I could tell him.
 Jake sighed again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe you could take a day off, or two -- a week?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he suggested.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're obviously not feeling well, everybody else gets sick days.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe.
 I don't know.
 I'm not actually 
\emph on
sick
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can it hurt to ask?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Probably not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I admitted.
 
\emph on
But only probably,
\emph default
 I thought.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asking Addy for time off, when she came to collect me the following day,
 did not literally hurt.
 It didn't even figuratively hurt.
 It didn't get me any time off, either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nonsense,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said when I tentatively suggested that I could skip a day.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're in perfect health.
 I'm already being rather gentle by scheduling only a couple of hours of
 work each day.
 Did you know that when I found Benjamin, way back when, we did nothing
 
\emph on
but
\emph default
 play with the elements for a solid week and a half? Come along, now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I followed her, bizarrely inclined to resent Benjamin, and we settled into
 our practice room and she extended her hand; when I didn't touch it right
 away she seized my wrist and held it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Go ahead and try the weapon Jane gave you,
\emph default
 invited Addy, a crafty little smile on her face, and I scowled and did
 exactly that.
 Send and 
\emph on
push
\emph default
 - 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy yanked her hand away from my arm and clutched at it like I'd burned
 her, but after a momentary hiss, she smiled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There you go,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said pleasantly, and she took hold of my hand again.
 
\emph on
Not as potent as Jane, but promising, certainly.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I could just zap you until you leave me alone.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy laughed at me.
 
\emph on
Elspeth, I am considerably faster than you, I am considerably more accustomed
 to pain than you, and now that you have this power, so have I.
 If you wish to turn this into a fight, you will lose, and would even without
 the threat of my sharing your secret with the others.
 Shall we spend a few seconds seeing precisely how long it would take me
 to subdue you? Do you think it would be amusing to invent an excuse for
 your wolf when you come home looking that run down? Or shall we get on
 with our day?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I attempted to glare at her, but had a suspicion that it came off as more
 of a pout.
 She smiled brightly and went on, 
\emph on
Let's go back to the range exercises.

\emph default
 Then she released my hand, and waited patiently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shut my eyes and bit my lip and wished I could convincingly fake the attempt,
 but I couldn't.
 I pointed my hand at Addy, imagined it as an antenna of some kind, and
 thought as hard as I could about that memory of the ticking grandfather
 clock in Oregon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forty-five mind-numbingly boring minutes later (which were nevertheless
 mercifully empty of torture), Addy's face lit up with a bright grin.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I saw that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she exclaimed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Marvelous.
 Do it again.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I forced another few seconds of clock-ticks through the air at her, and
 Addy smiled serenely.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now add in the audio and other components.
 Take your time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added generously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the next hour I gradually grouped together the entirety of the minutes
 I'd spent staring at that clock, folding in all the senses and feelings.
 It was exhausting, albeit only mentally -- I didn't want to sleep, so much
 as stare blankly into space.
 When the memory was complete, Addy tapped me on the nose to update her
 copy of my power.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mmm,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said happily.
 She scooted her chair back a foot.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Again.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was faster to get the extra twelve inches of range than it had been to
 get the first one, but I was completely drained once I'd managed it after
 thirty minutes of work.
 Addy finally acknowledged that I needed a break; she touched my nose again,
 and I sat, and looked at my shoes, and tried to relax.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can practice that on your own at home, I think,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said after a few minutes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think you should try to add at least a little bit of range every day without
 fail; if you skip days it runs more risk of sticking and becoming fixed.
 Oh, I wish I'd met more witches so young...
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is that why you won't let me have time off?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked.

Yes.
 Generally, the newer someone's power is, the more flexible it's seemed
 to be, but I met one witch who worked every day on an arbitarily scalable
 feature of his craft -- he was a telekinetic, but worked on a larger, less
 tidy scale than Hao, and upped his weight tolerance.
 By the time I met him, he was only increasing it by about a gram a day,
 but it was still going up and he was three hundred years old.

Is that what you did before you joined the Volturi? Just went all over the

 help?

 I didn't like using that word for what she was doing with

 a pure benefit from Addy's acquaintance until she moved to Volterra and
 started rounding up her old friends.

 I asked.

Let's practice while we have this conversation,
\emph default
 she sent without touching me, and I was suddenly glad that there was no
 longer a reason I had to hold her cold hands in order to do the work she
 wanted.
 The cold didn't bother me, exactly.
 For a long time everybody I touched was a vampire, all the same temperature.
 But since moving into the village and starting to need comfort on a regular
 basis, my source of comfort became Jake, who ran a couple of degrees warmer
 than me and 
\emph on
much
\emph default
 warmer than a human, let alone a vampire.

\begin_layout Standard
Then I thought of Jane and how her eyes

 touching

What made you decide to join the Volturi?

 I asked again in the approved way.
 Fatigue started to reassert itself, but ranged communication was getting

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Oh, I avoided it for a long time,

 replied Addy, a sigh in her mental voice.

Slipped under the radar.
 They found me while I was traveling with Joham and his daughters.

Noemi and Iseul aren't witches, right? Is Joham?

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
No, he's not,
\emph default
 she said.
 
\emph on
Anyway, a delegation of the Volturi showed up, looking for some half-vampires
 to learn more about them, and they had several witches along whose powers
 I'd never tasted before.
 I knew the Volturi had great witches among them and did want to learn about
 their crafts, but I'd avoided actually seeking them out because I thought
 it would be dangerous -- and then they were right there, irresistible.
 I touched Jane -

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
You could just show me this,
\emph default
 I pointed out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I'm not going to do that.

\emph default
 She didn't explain why, just continued the story.
 
\emph on
At that point Jane noticed me, and you've seen how lightly she takes her
 power, but I fought back instinctively; at that point they were a little
 too curious about me for me to escape notice.
 I decided to make the best of the situation -- at least as a member of
 the Volturi guard I would get to sample some of the most carefully handpicked
 witches in the world.
 And it's been an interesting few years, and I've collected most of my old
 friends and some highly interesting prizes that Aro's had his eye on, so
 now I have a great deal of choices at my fingertips.
 But it's so static, now; there's not a one in the guard whose power is
 still changeable as far as I can tell.
 You, though, Elspeth, you're growing all the time.

I nodded slowly.

Let's go back to the speed tests, and see if you can send a compressed memory

I lurched home an hour later, Addy at my shoulder, and flopped into Jake's
 arms when he got up at my entrance.
 Holding me up, he said,

 Addy said.

Do you want her power to atrophy? It will, you know, if she doesn't practice
 it.
 She could be more limited than she has to be, forever, based on a decision
 she made to avoid doing her homework at age

five

 Don't you want what's really best for her, not just what's easiest?

It was the exact right thing to say to make Jake back off, and he frowned
 solemnly and nodded once, still cradling me.

to look after her.

 Jake smiled tentatively, and Addy gave a little wave, spun on her heel,

Watch yourself,

Yeah,

The next day, Addy and I sat in opposite corners of the room to practice
 range and speed.
 She believed that I could eventually be a true 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

backwards Aro
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, only ranged and selective -- he had no choice but to absorb the entire
 memory of anyone he touched, whereas I could define beginnings and endpoints
 to what I wanted to share and send only that, only to my desired targets.
 
\emph on
In fact, that may be your limiting factor here,
\emph default
 Addy said, after I'd just barely squeezed a half-hour hunt into two seconds.
 
\emph on
Aro's beginning and end points are perfectly, automatically defined: birth
 and the moment at which he absorbs memory.
 You need to define your points deliberately, and you're accustomed to sifting
 along memories in real time, to decide as you go whether each second is
 something you want to offer or not.
 Let's break that habit once and for all.
 Send me everything.

\begin_layout Standard

What?!

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I think you know exactly what I meant, Elspeth,
\emph default
 replied Addy.
 
\emph on
Try to send me all of your memories from your earliest up to this moment.
 Here, if it will make it easier...

\emph default
 She got up and crossed the room to take my hand and place it on her face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I don't want -
\emph default
 Something in Addy's expectant smile stopped me.
 I might get out of doing this right away, but it would be replaced by something
 I liked less and then suggested again later.
 
\emph on
Everything?
\emph default
 I asked, forlorn.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Everything.
 Selectivity is holding you back.
 Don't be so shy; do you realize how many 
\emph default
thousands
\emph on
 of people's memories I have in my head? You have done nothing so unique
 and shocking in the past five years.
 This is not about me invading your privacy; I could do that by borrowing
 your father's power and asking embarrassing questions.
 This is about helping you break through your limitations.

\begin_layout Standard
I took a deep breath, bit my lip, and pushed.

\begin_layout Standard
Addy staggered away from my hand, and her eyes unfocused and her jaw went
 slack.
 She didn't fall, but for two full seconds, she wavered on the spot.
 Then, slowly, she straightened up and blinked, closing her mouth and looking
 very impressed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
That,
\emph default
 she said, 
\emph on
should you ever be particularly desperate, is a more effective weapon --
 at least the first time -- than your variant on Jane's power.

\emph default
 She held her hand out to me.
 
\emph on
Try it again, let's see if it works twice.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the second try, Addy recovered much more quickly; I barely saw the dip
 of her posture before she caught herself and smirked.
 
\emph on
Vastly diminished efficacy.
 Only a few seconds of the thoughts were new, of course -- this will, I
 expect, be a matter of delay between uses rather than a simple situation
 where it's only effective against a given target once.
