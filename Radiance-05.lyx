\begin_layout Chapter
Guesser
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jacob lit up to rival the sun when he saw me step back into the circle of
 tents.
 He didn't get up from where he was sitting, or try to usher me closer.
 Apparently he was settled on a strategy of letting his skittish imprint
 settle down alone.
 I felt his eyes on me, though, while I drifted towards Kim.
 She was finishing an angled French braid in Pera's hair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hullo, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Kim said to me gently when she'd finished putting the tie in place around
 the end of Pera's plait.
 Pera wandered towards where the food was kept and took a bottle of juice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want me to do your hair, too?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Kim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you wouldn't mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't reach well enough to brush it properly on my own, even, let alone
 braid it...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Kim said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You just stand there and I'll look after it, all right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She started carefully brushing out the ends of my hair and working her
 way up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was soothing, mostly.
 Kim isn't Mama, but Mama's not the only person who ever does my hair, either.
 Grandma Esme used to sometimes, and Aunt Rosalie, and occasionally humans
 like Kora's mother do too.
 So it wasn't too strange to let Kim tease the tangles out and twist strands
 into a thick, orderly rope.
 I closed my eyes and thought of nothing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have a lot of hair, and braiding it takes a long time, especially for
 a human.
 Thinking of nothing had just begun to become itchily boring when Kim snapped
 an elastic around the end of my braid and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There you are, then, Elspeth.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said politely, opening my eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jacob hadn't moved an inch from where he'd been when I showed up.
 I wasn't sure if he'd even blinked.
 He was just gazing at me, steadily and with a faintly awed smile on his
 face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I turned away, and cast about for something else to do.
 I considered the bag of munchies, but I wasn't really 
\emph on
hungry
\emph default
, only 
\emph on
bottomless
\emph default
.
 There were conversations going on around the camp.
 I listened, trying to see if any of them were such that I might join.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Daphne's probably old enough to activate now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Zachary said wistfully to Quil.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe she's friends with Brooke,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suggested Quil, sounding sad.
 I wasn't sure who they were talking about, exactly, but my best guess was
 relatives of theirs the Volturi had kidnapped for possessing the werewolf
 gene.
 I didn't want to intrude on that conversation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It hit me, not for the first time, but a little deeper: everyone in the
 pack was 
\emph on
damaged
\emph default
.
 I'm used to Mama being damaged.
 Technically I lost someone too.
 But I've only got a few days' worth of memories of Daddy.
 I don't think of him very often, since Mama ran out of stories to tell.
 It doesn't exactly 
\emph on
hurt
\emph default
 for him to be gone (or not often, anyway).
 But any of the wolves could have relatives in Volterra, in magically enforced
 service to their natural enemies.
 Any of the wolves 
\emph on
or
\emph default
 imprints would be bereaved, or had simply been torn from family back home
 when evacuated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four babies weren't really damaged the same way, I thought, but the
 way the pack lived was certainly an 
\emph on
odd
\emph default
 place to bring up a child.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody turned out okay, though.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I listened for other, safer conversations.
 Emily was attempting to interest Claire in a book which Claire thought
 had 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not enough pictures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while Sam held Paige and looked on.
 Maureen was nursing Natalie and telling a raptly attentive Victor about
 what she wanted to do the next time the pack stopped in a town; Ruth played
 with a battered teddy bear at her feet.
 Thea was chasing her little Noah between the trees.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Brady and Pera had stolen off a way for a little privacy, but I could just
 spot them kissing.
 I did some mental math and realized that Brady would have been 
\emph on
thirteen
\emph default
 when he imprinted on her, and she'd have been twenty-five at the time.
 That seemed nearly as questionable as Quil and Claire, for all that Brady
 had been the one to do the imprinting.
 Perhaps the kissing part was a recent development.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I scrunched my eyes shut for a moment, and tilted my head back to look at
 the sky.
 Eventually I grabbed an empty lawn chair and sat next to Kim.
 The pack sure had a lot of stuff.
 I supposed that they didn't need to move too fast anymore, and the wolves
 would be able to carry plenty as long as they could go at a sedate pace.
 How long would it take me to get to New York, if I stuck with them? Maybe
 we could sneak onto a train or something.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kim said conversationally, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So I hear Bella is alive after all, but Cody didn't explain in any detail.
 Will you tell me the story?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll show you, if you like,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I offered, and she nodded, curious.
 When I'd done that, and Kim had exclaimed over how remarkable it was, Maureen
 shoved by to demand a look at my witchcraft too.
 Soon I had a double line of wolves, imprints, and Cody, one line for each
 hand, who wanted to see what I had to show them.
 I rotated through them all with the summary of my explanation of Mama's
 survival, and when no one wanted to be done with the show, I shared things
 almost at random.
 It was delicious, to have an audience and no secrets to keep.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jacob didn't join either line, although he half-stood once when it was clear
 that everybody except the babies was lining up.
 Then he changed his mind and sat back down.
 Waiting for me to come to him, I supposed, even though I was letting every
 person in the pack have a look and it wasn't really a 
\emph on
special
\emph default
 thing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even when he had sat back down, he had that faint, happy look on his face.
 
\emph on
She's here, she exists, that's enough
\emph default
, was my guess as to what the smile meant -- but my guess wasn't necessarily
 any good.
 I didn't know him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would probably need to talk to him eventually, about going to New York.
 He 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 in charge, after all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This memory is in Chinese,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 complained Thea, occupying my left hand.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't understand it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's Swedish,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, pausing the display.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What we're saying isn't important, I'm just showing the scenery.
 It's a pretty sunrise.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I don't understand it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 Jared, standing at my other hand, rolled his eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I could leave out the sound, if you want,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm fast-forwarding and the conversation was already too fast for a human
 to follow, anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Make it in English,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Thea insisted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I...
 hang on a sec,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, dropping my hands and thinking.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I haven't tried to translate a memory before.
 I might be able to do it but I have to think.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It seemed like it should be possible.
 I'm all about making myself understood, after all: Thea can't understand
 Swedish, so I should be able to send her non-Swedish if I'm really doing
 what I think I am.
 Something like the way I summarized, when I showed Cody an abridged autobiograp
hy earlier...
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay, I'll try,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 I put my fingertips back where they'd been and rewound the sunrise conversation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't all that interesting, only Mama telling me about what she'd been
 doing between nearly getting killed and running into Uncle Jasper.
 (Mama wavers on whether she wants me to think of him as an uncle or not,
 but I usually do.) She'd been doing such dull things that she could talk
 about it in the incomplete Swedish she had, so it had been an opportunity
 for me to practice.
 I didn't 
\emph on
translate
\emph default
, exactly, not into English, but I sent the meanings of our words along
 with the senses and the feelings that were already attached to the memory.
 Thea seemed satisfied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was a very new and shiny amusement for the pack.
 They kept me occupied showing random things all morning and into the afternoon,
 and at last Emily wanted to know if I could teach languages that way.
 Everyone else drifted off to other activities.
 I fiddled around for a couple of hours, holding my palm to her cheek while
 she reported on my effectiveness patiently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know if this is getting me through the material any 
\emph on
faster
\emph default
 than drilling with Pera does,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mused Emily, while most of the pack were rummaging through the food supply
 for dinner, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but it seems like it'll 
\emph on
stick
\emph default
 better.
 Everything you send is so vivid and...
 and it feels 
\emph on
true
\emph default
, but I don't know how much sense that makes for vocabulary words...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know what you're talking about,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I assured her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's harder to forget things you really believe.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emily nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're a charming girl,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jacob...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She trailed off, and eyed me uncertainly.
 Maybe she'd been about to say something like 
\emph on
is lucky to have you
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
chose well
\emph default
 (as though he 
\emph on
chose
\emph default
).
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you go to bed as early as Cody does? We'll need to...
 figure out some sleeping arrangement, before you need sleep.
 We don't have an extra tent, so there will have to be some squeezing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm usually asleep an hour or two after sunset.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I counted seven tents, which looked like they'd hold two or three people,
 maybe four small people.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How are you arranged now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All the pairs together, parents share with our children, and Jacob and Zachary
 and Cody are tripled up in the green one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Emily said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perhaps Jacob will put Jared on night watch -- we need someone looking out
 for things like fire or other attacks that can still harm us even while
 we're hidden, before Cody wakes up and takes over by default,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she explained.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And you could share with Kim.
 That wouldn't be too crowded, at least.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sounds fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't look like rain, though, so I could just sleep outside...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nonsense,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Emily briskly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's about Jared's turn anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She couldn't 
\emph on
possibly
\emph default
 have missed the subtext that I 
\emph on
prefer
\emph default
 not to sleep in a tent with a non-Mama person, so I shrugged, supposing
 she had some reason to insist.
 If I were in a sleeping bag then I probably wouldn't disturb Kim with dream
 leakage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'll want to ask Jacob about the watch schedule, before you need to go
 to sleep, though,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suggested Emily.
 
\emph on
That
\emph default
 would explain why she wanted me in a tent, if she thought I ought to talk
 to him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She wasn't being even slightly subtle, so I went ahead and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There isn't a reason I have to check that myself.
 You only want me to talk to Jacob.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emily sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't understand why you aren't.
 What's stopping you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I...
 I don't know what to say to him.
 He could have gotten in the line,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said defensively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's giving you space because you are so 
\emph on
obviously
\emph default
 terrified of him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Emily.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And you have no reason to be.
 You know he won't do you any harm.
 There's nothing standing in your way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She reached her arm behind her, and Sam was suddenly at her shoulder as
 though summoned by the gesture.
 She touched his hand, patted it twice, and I looked up and watched him
 bend to kiss her hairline.
 Emily put her arm down, and Sam left, just about glowing with satisfaction
 as he plucked Paige from where she'd been resting in Kim's arms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a low voice, Emily said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't understand, at first, what I had -- what Sam gave me.
 I only thought that he had betrayed Leah.
 For weeks, I thought I was somehow being loyal to her, by hurting him.
 If I had your power, I would show you how much I regret it.
 Sam forgives me, of course.
 But I did hurt him.
 Jacob doesn't deserve to be hurt, Elspeth.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And her eyes said, 
\emph on
Please don't ruin our community by rejecting our leader.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I cringed, and glanced over to Jacob.
 He was still looking my way -- but when my face turned towards his, the
 faint smile disappeared and he snapped his eyes to Emily.
 He frowned at her, looking disappointed in her conduct.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, of course.
 He was too far off to hear a quiet conversation, but guilt would be all
 over my face, announced by magic if nothing else.
 Jacob would not approve of Emily making me feel bad, even on his behalf.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emily looked at Jacob and pursed her lips, then tossed her hair and got
 up to join Sam and their daughter where they stood without another word
 to me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I sat, tucked in towards myself as much as I could be without actually curling
 into a ball.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I heard quiet voices, just too soft for me to hear, and then someone tapped
 me on the shoulder.
 I looked up, and it was Cody, avoiding eye contact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jacob wants to know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if there's anything that I or anybody can do to make you feel better.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I just want to go to New York and find Mama,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll let him know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can take your time.
 It's okay.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He sighed, and went over to Jacob.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maureen brought me one of her daughters (Ruth, the older one) and said that
 if I had nothing to do I could talk to her in Spanish.
 That kept me occupied until Ruth asked how to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mother
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then yelled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Madre, Madre!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Maureen didn't understand that, until Pera tapped her on the arm and sent
 her to pick Ruth back up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the sun set, Cody went to bed first thing.
 Jared was put on night watch once others started drifting to their tents,
 and Kim told me so and invited me to sleep in her tent, but I said I would
 prefer to sleep under the stars.
 She gave me a sleeping bag and a pillow and I found a mossy spot, far off
 from the conversations of people who could and did stay up later than me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tossed and turned, and finally slept, to have my first night full of dreams
 that no one could see.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I woke up the next morning to darkness and quiet.
 But I wasn't the only one awake -- I could see Cody, who'd apparently already
 sent Jared to bed.
 He was pacing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cody?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I whispered, sitting up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, morning, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, also quiet enough to leave the sleepers asleep.
 He paused midstride and pivoted to look my way, though it looked like he
 was focusing on something over my left shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sleep all right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and it was close enough.
 I wasn't physically uncomfortable, at least.
 I tried to grasp at the fading threads of dreams, but they wouldn't stick.
 That night's worth was lost, then, and I couldn't even tell Mama about
 them later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're breaking camp to start for New York today,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody told me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm glad.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I climbed out of my sleeping bag and rolled it up into its case.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How long have you been up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Couple hours.
 Do you s'pose Joham's kids have this kind of weird sleep schedule? Early
 to bed, early to rise, to the point of absurdity?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked idly, but he sounded distracted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That wasn't one of the things my parents asked Nahuel when they visited
 him, or Mama would have told me.

We hunted together in silence.
 Sticking close to camp for night watch purposes, we found no large game,
 and instead consumed rabbits and half a flock of crows between us.

 He didn't seem to have much attention on our surroundings.

Yes,

 I followed, but slowly.

\begin_layout Standard
No one else woke up for the next hour and a half.
 In that time I tried to work out on my own what might be bothering Cody,
 because I thought something was, even if he wouldn't tell me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is how I use my power to learn things about other people.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It takes a very, very long time.
 It's completely indirect.
 There is some guesswork.
 There are always gaps.
 I can't just call up my power and point it at someone and learn who they
 are.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, I make a guess about the thing I am trying to learn.
 Then, I think of something about myself that is like my guess.
 And then I figure out how I would explain that part of myself to the person,
 and see if the explanation refers to things about my guess.
 If it is, then my guess was close to right.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's confusing, and it took me a long time to figure out.
 Here's how it might work.
 Suppose I go back to Kora's town and find her, and she seems sad.
 I figure out as much as I can without any magic and I decide that my best
 guess is that she misses her best friend who is out of town.
 The closest thing I have to that is when I miss people who I have had to
 leave behind -- people like Kora.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I think about how I would tell her the way I feel about that.
 If I wanted to say to Kora, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I miss my old friend Raine as much as you miss your best friend
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then that would mean 
\emph on
saying that will make Kora understand something true
\emph default
, because that is how my power works.
 Then I would know that my feelings about Raine and Kora's about her friend
 are the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it would 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 make sense to tell Kora that.
 I'm never going to see Raine again, and Kora's friend will come home, for
 one thing.
 I knew Raine for a much shorter time and we were not as close.
 And that is the biggest problem with using my power to do this.
 It only works if I make a correct guess, and I can only make a correct
 guess if I have something that's sort of like what's going on for the other
 person.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is how I missed what was wrong with Cody.

The others in the pack got up almost in unison, even Jared, who had only
 had a couple hours of sleep.
 After they ate breakfast, we packed up all the things in the camp.
 Zachary showed me how to break down a tent, and how to lash a batch of
 them to Sam so he could run without dropping anything.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zachary also offered to let me ride on his back -- all of the other imprints
 rode their own respective wolves, but no one suggested that I go with Jacob.
 I thanked him, but I decided to go on my own feet, like Cody did.
 I carried a few of the sleeping bags.
 I need sleep, but it's on a rigid schedule; in the middle of the day I
 don't get tired no matter what I do.
 I kept up with the wolves as we ran, listened to imprints shouting conversation
s at each other over the wind, and took in scenery.
 Once or twice I came up with new guesses about Cody, but I couldn't verify
 any of them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we were hidden, we didn't need to avoid populated places.
 We ran along the edge of a highway for most of the day, and it did indeed
 look like the cars were driving themselves; even weighed down with cargo
 and riders, the pack could keep pace with slower traffic in the right lane,
 and I went alongside a station wagon for a bit peering in through the window.
 At noon, we stopped so the wolves could eat without detouring to hunt,
 and then piled them back up with stuff to carry and moved on again.
 We were in Illinois by nightfall.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To my surprise, we didn't stop in an empty place and set up tents.
 Instead we went into a town, and found a hotel.
 I asked Cody about it.
 He seemed to have something else on his mind, but explained, while we waited
 for someone to open the door so it wouldn't appear to swing wide of its
 own accord to unhidden people.

We only camp out sometimes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sometimes we find unoccupied houses, or hotels with empty rooms, and we
 haunt them a bit.
 It's nice to have running water, and even if something we do is seen, it
 would be sort of hard to have the Volturi after us more than they already
 are.
 I mean, I guess it's technically possible, we could kill one of their wives
 or something,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he mused.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But anyway, yeah, we're in a hotel for the night.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

How do we get into rooms?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Pera hides the door, unhides whoever's going in, they walk right through
 it, she unhides it, and they open it for us from the inside,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Cody.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Clever,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I observed, wondering where his jokes had gone.
 The door to the hotel creaked open, and the pack jostled through it; I
 was sure that this made the door appear to stick open for an unnaturally
 long time, but no one was likely to figure it out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hotel had enough empty rooms that I got my own.
 I helped myself to the running water.
 And then, before I went to bed, I decided to give up on figuring out Cody,
 and try my new tool for figuring out myself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I sat on the bed, put my hand on my face, and put myself back in the blank
 place with two of me.
 I tried the idea of signing at myself, and was very disoriented to find
 that only one of me did it.
 
\emph on
Hello
\emph default
, that one signed, and I 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

saw
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 double: the one whose hands were still saw the one who greeted her, and
 vice-versa, no longer a perfect mirror.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I put my hand down.
 That was really 
\emph on
weird
\emph default
.
 And if I didn't give my selves names, I was going to get dizzy trying to
 think of which did which thing.
 But I didn't know what to call them.
 Not that I was short of names -- any pair of aliases would have done, or
 just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

One
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Two

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I sat up and looked at the clock in the room.
 It was not quite five a.m.
 Sam was on night watch -- even in a building, there were possible avenues
 of attack the Volturi could use, or some other reason to move.
 But if it was an emergency, wouldn't he have forced the door down...?
