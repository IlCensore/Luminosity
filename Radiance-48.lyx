Healer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shortly after, my mother called me and told me to come back to the compound.
 I 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 getting tired, so I excused myself to Didyme and John and Dr.
 Valenti.
 Addy avoided touching me -- probably thought she'd find lying and mindreading
 useful, reasonably enough -- and stayed behind to wrangle the mnemically
 disordered and their caretakers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stopped in the throne room to see what was going on.
 All of the fragments of Volturi were gone from the floor, either turned
 to ash or reconstructed as participants in the new order; Alec was gone
 too.
 My mother was arguing, although not particularly heatedly, with Siobhan.
 Their respective mates were there, but not participating in the conversation;
 my father had his hand linked with my mother's but appeared distracted,
 and occasionally muttered something about the goings-on he was listening
 to.

-- acknowledge that you were indispensable,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I acknowledge that you didn't have to let me step up, that you could have
 done so yourself, and that you probably still could if you decided to.
 And that's why I'm offering the compromise 
\emph on
conditional on
\emph default
 you trying 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 meal of animal blood.
 You have the blast memories; you're in a better position than 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 am, even, to guess that it has beneficial cognitive effects.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To guess, sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not exactly conclusive.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's a small sample size,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 allowed my mother, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but I don't think I'm asking much.
 One meal.
 Enough to turn your eyes gold.
 See if you think it's worth the tradeoff.
 If you don't, I'm prepared to consider you sufficiently self-controlled
 even on a human blood diet that I'll give you dispensation to get it in
 a less sentient package.
 Ransack whatever the Irish equivalent of the Red Cross is, if you decide
 that you'd prefer to go on living in Ireland after all regardless of where
 I set up.
 But I think it was 
\emph on
fairly predictable
\emph default
 that I wouldn't be allowing murder.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And Liam?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan inquired, arching an eyebrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Same deal.
 I remand him to your custody, so to speak,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said with a dry sigh.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I suppose there's no reason in principle you couldn't have different diets,
 but -- yeah.
 Same deal.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And if I don't like this deal?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked.
 She didn't sound challenging, exactly -- she was just going through her
 options, all of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then I guess you can try to take me and my fledgling empire down, and I
 get to see how my new bodyguard is going to work out in practice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, staring up unblinking into Siobhan's eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your who? You don't mean Edward, do you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Elsie, would you come here?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother called over to me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And it's not Elspeth, either, if that's what you're thinking,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know Elspeth can't take you down now that you're already blasted.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I went over to the group, and my mother put her hand on my shoulder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I noticed that Allirea was standing there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I blinked at Allirea, who realized that I'd gone under my mother's shield.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, hello,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, I have this job now.
 Don't look at me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added, moving around to stand behind her new employer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I boggled for a moment, then turned to Siobhan and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It would be a bad idea to attack her.
 You wouldn't win.
 If I tried to explain why it wouldn't make sense to you, but it's true.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan took in this information with puzzlement, but nodded, slowly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

One meal,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, holding up her index finger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother nodded and, to her credit, didn't even look especially smug as
 Siobhan and Liam left the room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mama, how did you get her to take the job?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Asked nicely, and promised not to acknowledge her existence when it isn't
 necessary,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There will be a gap in coverage, so to speak, when she catches up with her
 family.
 I can fill in with Renata if it seems necessary then.
 But she's agreed to stick around while I handle...
 things like that, early on.
 I might call on you to vouch for her existence a few more times in the
 coming days.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and I looked at the clean floor, free of ash-pile hints.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who lived and who died?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alec, Renata, Santiago, Dwi, Emel, Zafrina, Benjamin and Tia, and Vasanti
 and Mehul were all willing to take jobs in the Empire; I'll figure out
 exactly what they all do when I draw up an org chart.
 Corin's dead, Heidi's dead, Felix and the other non-witch miscellaneous
 guards are dead, Charles and Emere and Li-qing and Pyotr are dead, Taamusi
 and Valdis are dead.
 Abdelmajid, Hao and Kazuo, and Sukutai and Okey don't want Empire employment
 but convinced us they wouldn't stir up anything untoward if let to go free,
 so we did.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about the people we brought with us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wait for the org chart,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother advised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I yawned.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think I'll go to bed now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother stroked my hair.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sleep well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
I found Jake in our room, in wolf form but asleep in the living area.
 I went around him, tucked myself in, and nodded off.

When I woke up the next morning, Jake was awake too, and not wolf-shaped
 anymore.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Morning, Elsie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said when I sat up in bed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We've got a wolf-related verdict.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, hopping up and going to sit at our table.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm going to head up the pack that works for your mom,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think you could've called that one in advance, right? Becky's going to
 lead the group that wants to go to La Push like she does.
 And Rachel and the ones who wanted to travel to random places finally backed
 off, and Rachel's going to stay here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who's going where, among the non-alphas?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not set in stone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But it looks like the wolves with Quileute or Makah imprints, plus Darren
 since Thea came from Forks, are mostly going back to La Push, and the wolves
 with Italian imprints are staying here, and the ones without imprints are
 mostly defaulting to working for your mom unless they follow a brother
 or similar elsewhere -- like, Paul and Harriet might stay here because
 Miles is staying here because of Esta.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about the orphan puppies?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked slowly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, before, they were just raised communally, because of the whole `we
 are all friends here' enforced vibe of togetherness,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jake.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So it's not clear who they belong to if not all of the wolves and imprints
 as a group.
 I think some people might semi-formally adopt one or two apiece and take
 them along wherever.
 Or Rachel's pack might just raise them together, here, so they don't have
 to get uprooted again.
 Or some combination.
 For that matter some of the younger wolves are still 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 young, thirteen and fourteen and fifteen, but I guess they'll just fold
 into the packs and go where they want like everyone else...
 there was already a fair amount of mentoring going on, really.

Where's Cody going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With his brother and sister,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Last I heard they were leaning towards going back to La Push, but they might
 change their minds, I'm not sure.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll probably visit Forks sooner or later,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, leaning my chin on my wrists on the table.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To meet my grandfather.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I remember him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remarked Jake.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a good guy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I just hope that, you know, everything that happened back then didn't wreck
 him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

His best friends died and he thought my mom died too, and he knew Carlisle
 and Esme and Rosalie and Emmett were taking care of me, but then as far
 as he knew I disappeared and might be dead too.
 My grandma RenÃ©e doesn't even know I was ever born.
 She thinks my mom died while pregnant with me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your mom was never pregnant,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, but she said she was, to grandma RenÃ©e, since she didn't know about
 vampires and stuff.
 When I was a newborn I got dozens of pictures taken of me every day, so
 they could send them to her later when they would make sense according
 to the timeline they gave her.
 I think now we're probably going to tell her everything.
 Probably her husband Phil, too.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do you have any idea where your mom is going to rule from?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think it'll be here, but I don't know where else it would be.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What do you suppose the odds are on a volcano fortress?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he laughed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Better than you might think, with Benjamin on the team,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I giggled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think me and you and your pack will probably live in a village-like extension
 of the volcano fortress or other center of the empire, though, since I'd
 bet anything Alice will be helping.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aw.
 The mere suburbs of the volcano fortress.
 Oh well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He grinned at me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, Your Imperial Highness, do you think I get a fancy title too?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you want one?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I guessed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think those are mostly just for fun.
 Or at least they are now.
 They might accumulate some gravitas in the next fifty or a hundred years.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hmm,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, thoughtfully stroking his chin.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh well, I'll think on that.
 You want breakfast?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Very much,

After breakfast, which was dinner for Jake as he'd been up all night again,
 I spent the morning standing near my mother as she made it clear, through
 my honesty voice, to various people that they really didn't want to try
 to attack her.
 Soon after, she fetched Renata and was only seen in her company for the
 rest of the day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noonish, the wolves with local imprints went out into the world to find
 the imprints' families.
 They were, by and large, still affected by Chelsea's lingering work, telling
 them that those families weren't interesting enough to be worth contacting,
 but they were able to appreciate the idea that it would be good to let
 their children meet their grandparents and aunts and uncles and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother had given them all permission to tell the immediate relatives

 She'd given a whole general address about the subject of what she called

 Everybody already 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

informed of things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Jake snickered almost interminably at this for some reason) could get
 permission to disclose said things to people they knew, and although they
 were still expected to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reasonably discreet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

My mother planned to set up something suitably bureaucratic to turn people

I want to do that in person -- I think we'll accompany Becky's pack to La

 I'd really like to turn them both, but Charlie already turned me down once...
 not sure about RenÃ©e.

Can one of them be a volcano fortress?

 I asked.

My mother appeared to give this idea serious consideration, then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, I don't think so.
 A volcanic eruption is on the short list of things that can kill a vampire,
 so it seems like a bad idea.
 Someone from a volcano observatory might also notice us.
 As soon as keeping a supply line going is feasible, though, I'll put a
 capital on the moon; how's that?

It doesn't sit right to leave them unaware of what's going on.

It made me a little queasy to think of Heidi's bus, historically used to
 transport the Volturi's meals, carrying people ever again.
 But it was a perfectly good bus, and there were paint and stencils intended
 for the exact purpose of making it look like it belonged to various organizatio
ns to deflect suspicion.
 I waited in the garage with Addy, while Rosalie re-lettered the side of
 the vehicle.
 Rosalie had been parked in the garage like she was a car herself since
 we'd taken over, oohing and aahing over all the vehicles.
 There weren't that many of them, considering, but there were more than
 the average garage in a Cullen house contained.

 Addy's work, voluntarily carried out with Chelsea's power, and perhaps
 it doesn't matter to anyone that it didn't grow that way.
 And between the princess and Addy herself, sea-green shot through with
 cobalt wrapped in a milky sheen: mutual acknowledgement of usefulness,
 they enjoy each other's company, but there's mistrust.
 On both sides.
