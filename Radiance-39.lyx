\begin_layout Standard
In the morning, I woke up to find my mother already on the phone discussing
 something with Siobhan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I kept Elspeth shielded all night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And she's still under it now.
 But if I extend the shield to cover Allirea, 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 part of it snaps back when I lose hold of my concentration for so much
 as a tenth of a second, and I still haven't managed to let Elspeth back
 through my 
\emph on
inner
\emph default
 shield at all.
 I'm not sure, but I think I could keep Edward shielded the way I can Elspeth
 -- like the shield is reacting to my personal affections somehow.
 Good morning, Elsie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added, glancing down and letting my hand go.
 I wondered if she'd been holding it all night in spite of the fact that
 she could no longer see me dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good morning,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you can't get around that limit on the shield, maybe it should be a priority
 to go in and get Dad out? Allirea might be able to get into the dungeon
 through the window and get him -- and David, and maybe even Marcus if we
 want him -- out.
 Then you can shield Dad and that's two people Jane and Alec and so on can't
 touch, which is worse than everybody on our side, but better than just
 one.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice looked,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and Marcus's other eye isn't in bits, it's sitting completely whole on top
 of the rest of him.
 We're not sure if Aro did that because he managed to think of a contingency
 plan regarding Allirea, or just because he figured he might as well, but
 without Bella able to shield Allirea, Allirea can't get the prisoners out
 of the dungeon undetected.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother's mouth was a grim line, but she evinced no surprise; this had
 been discussed overnight, apparently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Damn it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she muttered, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've 
\emph on
managed
\emph default
 to keep a shield over Allirea for hours at a time before...
 I just can't 
\emph on
count
\emph default
 on it...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you've said that repeatedly.
 Also, to catch Elspeth up, we have repeatedly gone over the fact that Addy
 might be willing and able to cover Allirea with your power if you knew
 how to open up your inner shield and let her copy you but you can't even
 let Elspeth in; we have repeatedly remarked on the fact that it would be
 very useful if there were a dozen of you; and we have repeatedly observed
 that you would probably have better control of your shield generally if
 you weren't trying to operate without ready access to your mate, in what
 you have repeatedly observed is a catch-22.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mama,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

besides me and Dad, do you like the others in the family enough to reliably
 shield them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I haven't tried it yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm reasonably sure I could do Carlisle and Esme, although maybe not as
 well as you.
 Rosalie and Emmett would probably be easier than Allirea, but I don't know
 by how much.
 I think I remember Jasper trying to kill me a little too vividly to protect
 him effectively before getting good general control.
 Alice...
 I don't know.
 I haven't talked to her much since you got back.
 I imagine she's different than she was before.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why haven't you tried it yet?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because I keep trying to keep Allirea covered, except for right now because
 if I cover both of you you'll forget her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I can pull it off -- well, we have repeatedly observed that if I could
 shield Allirea reliably there would be no problem at all.
 It's seemed like the best area to focus my efforts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe I should give up on that and concentrate on something else, like trying
 the rest of the family.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have a question,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tanya's voice from Siobhan's end of the phone connection.
 It was quiet enough to be difficult to pick out, so I pulled out my cell
 and dialed in.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's assume we win -- we kill or poach all the Volturi and the wolves,
 and we have a party to celebrate.
 Then what?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good question,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because I don't want to rule the world,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tanya said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think Kate would feel the same way, and Eleazar and Carmen, and while
 I haven't gotten to know Garrett that well yet, I think it would grate
 on his eternally-fixed revolutionary sensibilities.
 I think Carlisle would work in theory, but I imagine it'd fall apart in
 practice, and his kids are follower types, except
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured my mother.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess you're not a follower,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tanya agreed, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but if Edward doesn't live
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't say those words in that order,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother hissed.
 She visibly brought her temper under control, and then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please.
 If something dreadful were to happen...
 then I would probably not be in good shape to rule the world.
 I managed a very limited sort of life believing him dead, but it didn't
 involve anything so grandiose, and I couldn't have handled it if it had.
 But right now Edward is 
\emph on
alive
\emph default
, albeit in...
 conditions I don't want to consider any more than I already have...
 and he may remain that way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, you want to be queen of the world?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked my mother.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's crossed my mind before, but Tanya also has a point,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother ground out.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who else could do it? The power vacuum will need filling.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I 
\emph on
could
\emph default
...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mused Siobhan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'd be good at it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I put in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I don't really have an interest in the world.
 I'm mostly concerned with Ireland.
 I suppose I'd 
\emph on
take
\emph default
 the queen of the world job, if I had to in order to prevent worldwide chaos...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do we know anyone else who makes a decent backup?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Romanians are out, I think...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They don't even want the world the way it is now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

according to Maggie, who thought to check.
 Too many witches, too much technology.
 They're only in it for revenge against the Volturi about losing their reign
 in the first place.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Names were tossed back and forth, mostly for completeness rather than any
 sense of plausibility.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Would you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked my mother during a lull, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

enforce vegetarianism?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I could figure out a way to do it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother replied evenly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But it would be very difficult.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not if Pera lived and would work for you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother blinked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That...
 would...
 work,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she acknowledged, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if Pera herself were willing to go vegetarian...
 a hidden vampire couldn't eat anyone, although I suppose they could still
 wreak assorted havoc and rob blood banks.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure to what extent this already went without saying, so I'm going
 to say it: deprogram Pera if you 
\emph on
possibly
\emph default
 can.
 The only people she 
\emph on
plausibly
\emph default
 would not be able to singlehandedly defeat are Allirea -- who would have
 her at a standoff that one of them wouldn't know was happening -- and Kate,
 who she might not be able to affect fast enough to avoid being thrown to
 the ground by the charge.
 Even Renata's shield might not understand a light tap on the head as an
 attack.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I 
\emph on
see
\emph default
 Pera I'll do it right away.
 My power doesn't go through hers, though, so if she's hiding I can't.
 I tried to send something to Mama before while I was hidden and she wasn't
 -- before Mama blocked me out, I mean -- and it didn't work.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You shouldn't discount the possibility that your power will go through Pera's
 
\emph on
with regards to Pera herself,
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cautioned Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It might not.
 But consider that Pera can see and hear and so on people who aren't `where'
 she is -- she might get transmissions via your magic as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess I can just periodically try to aim at her whether I spot her or
 not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said dubiously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What would be more useful,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

would be if she'd instantly fall for one of the unmated guys who are with
 us -- that's, let's see, Alistair, Randall, seven of the Brits who are
 still in Britain, and the Romanians?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 When she said Alistair's name, someone -- possibly Mary, one of the American
 visitors -- laughed one loud 
\emph on
ha
\emph default
.
 I shuffled through Carlisle's memories to dredge up the fact that Alistair
 was a complete misanthrope.
 I wondered how he was putting up with being in such a crowded area for
 so long.
 It was interesting to imagine him with a mate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice can check that, can't she?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If they cooperate, I mean, each of them could decide one at a time to walk
 into the Volturi compound...?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If they decided to just walk in,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice would probably see them getting killed, possibly before even crossing
 paths with Pera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not if they went in announcing that they were there to sell us out, or went
 in with one of the Denalis after some preliminary e-mails were lobbed back
 and forth.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wait,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice was pretty much mated to Jasper -- I'm not sure about the other way
 around -- when she just saw a vision of him.
 Maybe Alice should just show a vision of Pera to all the single guys we
 have on our side?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That would work if I could see her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice piped up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can't see Pera?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked my mother, bewildered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Like a half-vampire or a wolf?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not exactly...
 I can 
\emph on
look at
\emph default
 her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not blocked outright.
 But she's invisible.
 I can tell you where she is -- it's the second room from the left on the
 third floor of the building, that's where my vision centers when I try
 to see her -- but just like I don't see in, say, infrared when I use my
 precognition, I don't see through to her hiding place, any more than I
 could if I were standing right there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She must unhide sometimes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To stay in touch with the others and let Chelsea work on her, if nothing
 else.
 They wouldn't have turned her if they weren't pretty sure they could control
 her.
 Keep an eye out, Alice.
 If Elspeth shows memories of Pera to candidate mates, that 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 work where applicable, but we can't count on it, since unlike with yours
 there's no precedent, and anyway most of the single males on our side are
 in Britain and out of her range, whereas you have...
 no limit, is that right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

None I've run across,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice confirmed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I nearly drove Jasper bonkers from Italy while he was in Tennessee,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she reminded us guiltily.
 I heard a mumbling attempt from Jasper to protest at this description,
 probably to soothe her guilt over her more active part in his sanity impairment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's a near-certainty that Pera will unhide at 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 point in the future,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can't you get even a blurry look at that -- even if you don't know when
 or where or whether she'll be standing on her head at the time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's very blurry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think I'd recognize Jasper that blurry if I didn't know who I was
 looking at -- someone who's never seen Pera before is probably not going
 to discover that she's his mate based on this mess.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Liam, call Maggie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said, and I heard beeping as her mate did as she asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So she can distribute the information over there so no one is caught too
 off guard by the visions when we figure out a way to do this.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Liam's voice -- and barely audible replies from Maggie -- threaded their
 way through the phone, but I tuned them out to hear the conversation I
 was actually having.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So if Eleazar or someone decides to e-mail Volterra,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with...
 what would be a good excuse for a Denali to escort a vampire into the compound?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think a Denali escort would help,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

since David is still there -- it would be too plausible that they'd be there
 to try to bust him out, and Aro would insist on a read before they got
 anywhere near Pera, and then the jig would inevitably be up.
 I'm not sure there's any way to have such a person get in to see Pera before
 letting Aro touch them, in fact.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are any of the Brits witches?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nathan, the one from the Isle of Man, is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told her, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but he won't say what it is that he does.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's obnoxious,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother pronounced.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is he planning to enlighten us at any point in the future?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unclear,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan disgustedly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm somewhat tempted to pick up everybody here, consolidate in Britain,
 and throw Eleazar at him.
 Alice, can you see by any chance...?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He hasn't made up his mind about it yet, I guess.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Speaking of picking up and moving everybody,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, and Emmett are the only people with current
 paper identities.
 Or, I have a legal identity I could still pass for, but I'm legally 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
.
 That leaves a lot of people to sneak onto an airplane or even two of them.
 If we're going to want to mass in Britain or whatnot 
\emph on
soon
\emph default
, it's probably about time to start sending the rest of us running east.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's a perfect accident that I find her.
 I'm here passing through this town, hunting, on my way to follow up on

 Nine times out of ten, those are nothing at all (although I suppose it
 is mildly interesting how they manage to convince everyone they're something
 when they're not), and the remaining one of ten is usually such a minor
 power, so faintly tasted, that they're not worth the effort it takes to
 find them, but I look them up anyway.
 Just in case.
 Professional curiosity.

 Hm.
 To introduce myself and hope she doesn't vanish again, or to touch her
