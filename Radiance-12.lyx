\begin_layout Chapter
Welcomer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't keep track of time while I was under the wolf's paws.
 I just lay there and hoped my legs would be okay.
 I knew I could heal fast, but I didn't know how much the ability extended
 or how smart it was -- would my hard skin make it impossible to set the
 bones without more damage? What if they healed wrong and I couldn't walk
 again? What if Santiago didn't know anything about half-vampires and broken
 legs would be fatal for some obscure reason that nobody could predict because
 we're so rare...? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was more screeching from broken vampires, more barking and shouting
 from the fighting wolves, all muffled by paw-pads on one ear and soil on
 the other, and finally I heard a muffled woman's voice: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let her up, Brooke.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paws lifted, but I didn't move, and I screwed my eyes shut.
 Chilly vampire hands seized my legs one at a time and twisted them and
 pushed, and that hurt more than the 
\emph on
breaks
\emph default
 had, and I screamed and the wolf who'd been holding me whined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There, now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the woman, and I opened one eye, and it was Santiago, businesslike
 even as a divot in her neck healed bright white and scarred.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't do anything foolish like trying to walk, and that should heal in a
 day or two, you won't even need casts.
 Brooke, you're her wheelchair, understand? Go get in uniform and pick her
 up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The brown-and-cream wolf nodded once, trotted away, and walked back on two
 quieter feet.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uniform
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 turned out to be a black sleeveless dress-like thing, held together with
 snaps and velcro that might let it survive a few phasings without tearing.
 She looked sort of like Quil, same curve to the lips and eyebrows, but
 even though all the wolves looked the same age she had a younger glint
 in her eyes.
 A little sister, maybe.
 I didn't ask, I just closed my eyes again and let her pick me up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Brooke in my ear, adjusting me in her arms.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You let me know pronto if I jostle you wrong, okay? I don't wanna hurt you.
 We're just gonna take you home with us, and it'll be okay, all right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I made some whining noise, which could have been taken any which way, and
 stretched my neck just enough to look at the battlefield.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heaps of vampire bits and shreds of clothes everywhere.
 Kate was reattaching one of her fingers, Eleazar was staring at what had
 to be the least interesting item on the ground there, while Carmen smoothed
 his hair.
 Tanya was looking away, standing stiffly and holding her arm on while it
 healed.
 Some wolves were limping, and one human-shaped one was applying some kind
 of suction device to a wound on another's shoulder -- maybe removing poisonous
 venom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Santiago surveyed the damage and frowned thoughtfully.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Harriet, Danielle, Iris,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said finally, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you three get the witches into boxes.
 We're taking all of them this time, I don't know what ever 
\emph on
possessed
\emph default
 Addy to leave the empath behind.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Three wolves ran off and came back as girls with heavy wooden boxes; they
 carefully picked up pale shining fragments as Santiago directed and dropped
 them into the containers.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not David,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pleaded Carmen.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please, he's family.
 We could have argued him around if he hadn't needed innocent thoughts to
 trick Edward.
 He'll give you no trouble from now on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Santiago pursed her lips and eyed Carmen, sizing her up.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He fought us,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she pointed out.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Daphne will be out of commission for days from that bite.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She inclined her head towards the smallest wolf, the white one with the
 nasty chunk out of her shoulder and bloodstains pinking the fur on that
 leg.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But she's alive,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Carmen said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can control David.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Santiago looked at Carmen speculatively, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fine.
 Wendy, torch the other 
\emph on
two
\emph default
.
 Note,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she went on, glancing back to the other vampires, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that I'm not the ultimate authority here.
 My decision can be overridden.
 But for now, you can keep him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A light brown wolf loped away, and came back in uniform with a lighter
 in hand.
 Santiago pointed her to the two piles that I guessed were Peter and Charlotte.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I closed my eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

TheywereonlyhereasafavortoJasper,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I blurted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I almost expected to be ignored, but when I peeked, Wendy looked my way,
 and then at Santiago, and I continued.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They didn't want to come.
 They only owed Jasper because he helped them a long time ago.
 If you let them go they'll give up and go home, you've already 
\emph on
got
\emph default
 Jasper and he can't ask them for anything anymore, you don't have to kill
 them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We would be willing to keep an eye on them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Carmen put in swiftly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are you, the Denali Reform Institute for Vampires Who Were Only Criminals
 That One Time And Might Be Good Now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Wendy in a snide undertone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wendy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Santiago sharply, and the wolf ducked her head apologetically and
 mumbled something.
 Santiago looked back at Carmen.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not confident in your ability to handle all three of them alone.
 Keep them in pieces, all three, and I'll get in touch with an answer on
 which, if any, may live before they're liable to starve.
 If I find you've let them reconstruct themselves before hearing from me
 or one of my superiors 
\emph on
it will not go well with you
\emph default
, do you understand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We understand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Tanya.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you care what we do with her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Eleazar said, pointing downward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Santiago blankly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm pointing at someone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you care what happens to her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Santiago peered briefly in the direction his finger was aimed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't waste my time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, and Carmen looked confusedly at her mate.
 Santiago then turned to the three wolves who'd collected bits of Daddy
 and Jasper and Alice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you get everything?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked, and they nodded in unison.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good.
 Let's get ready to head out, girls.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wolves who were still wolf-shaped phased and got into uniforms, and
 the whole ones put slings and bandages where they needed to be on the damaged
 ones.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Santiago,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Wendy asked after putting her lighter away, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what about the other Cullens on their way here?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why, our allies will receive them as welcome guests, of course,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Santiago, nodding to an uncomfortable Tanya.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And tell them that we must have captured their friends and family at the
 airport, because they never arrived and David, who went to meet them, never
 came home.
 And keep the pieces of David and the other two properly secreted away,
 because they wouldn't care to find out what happens if they don't.
 And encourage the rebels to use their home as a base of operations.
 And send us,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she continued with a graceful twist of her hand, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a list, of every far-flung friend and acquaintance that Carlisle and his
 coven can bring here to help, and every one who he cannot.
 And do us the kindness of letting us know where we can find the disloyal
 in convenient, manageable groups, as when they go hunting or recruiting.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Denalis were silent, and Santiago prodded, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't that what you'll do? I highly recommend it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and Tanya nodded.
 Santiago looked at her, and then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Harriet, perhaps you should get another box for David.
 We can look after him in Volterra.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Carmen bit her lip, Tanya clenched her fists, Eleazar turned away, and Kate
 bowed her head, but no one protested while Harriet fetched a fourth box
 and gathered David's twitching shards into it, piece by piece.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Santiago, when that task was complete.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think it's time we went home, girls.

\begin_layout Standard
Santiago and the wolves had a big military-type helicopter, which Danielle
 piloted.
 Brooke held me and sat on the edge of a row of seats so no one would nudge
 my legs accidentally.
 They still throbbed, but by the time the helicopter lifted off into the
 air, the pain was starting to ease marginally.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're gonna get you home to Jacob,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Brooke promised.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He'll be so happy to see you! He was completely frantic, our pack and Rachel's
 had to absorb his wolves temporarily because he was com-
\emph on
plete
\emph default
-ly out of control.
 I wonder if we're gonna have to permanently reorg once he's better,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she mused, pursing her lips.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's going to happen to me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, hating how squeaky I sounded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, oh Elspeth honey, you're gonna be okay!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Brooke said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I promise! Don't be scared! You're an 
\emph on
imprint
\emph default
.
 You're an 
\emph on
alpha's
\emph default
 imprint.
 That makes you so special, you have no idea, you are looking at a 
\emph on
really nice
\emph default
 setup.
 You get to live in the village and you don't even have to work or anything
 like we do, you just have to spend some time with Jacob so he's not, you
 know, I'd make the swirling-my-finger-around-my-ear gesture but I'm not
 supposed to put you down.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Village?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mm-hm.
 That's where the wolves and the imprints and the puppies all live,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Brooke explained.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And Cody, that's where they put him too, but he's in East with the Clearwaters
 -- except I have no idea where any of us are gonna wind up after the reorg
 if there is a reorg, it's kind of complicated.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

East?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Brooke sounded like she was trying to be informative, but she wasn't very
 good at it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The village has four sections, East and West and South and North,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They've got nicknames but 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 think we should call them by the 
\emph on
proper
\emph default
 names that Santiago and Felix and Afton and Corin use.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She nodded smartly, looking very proud of herself for this.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

East is for Rachel's pack, and West is for us -- we're Becky's.
 The pack members who don't have imprints, I mean.
 Boys with imprints, from whatever pack, live in South, and the puppies,
 if they don't have families to live with, live in North.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You keep saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

puppies

\end_inset

The kids who can't activate yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Brooke said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's just what we call them, since they're not just ordinary kids, but
 they aren't wolves 
\emph on
yet
\emph default
, either.
 From the reservation back when, or who were picked up since, or who were
 
\emph on
born
\emph default
 since.
 Every now and then one grows up enough and goes 
\emph on
floof
\emph default
 and then somebody's got a new packmate.
 Ashleigh just joined up with Rachel's crew last month.
 We had a party for her.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, glancing at the rows of girls, all in the same uniforms with short
 haircuts and athletes' shapes, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are there only girls here?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're a field team,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 explained Brooke.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're not going to spontaneously imprint, so it's safer to have us running
 all hither and yon -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hither and yon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, isn't that funny? Afton says it all the time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She said Afton's name like he was her favorite teacher, or wise general,
 or something.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The boys who aren't imprinted stay home, so if they see some girl she's
 right there where Chelsea can look at her and bring her into the village.
 And the boys who 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 imprinted are supposed to be making puppies.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She giggled.
 I wondered how old she was.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't...
 bother you at all, that Chelsea does what she does?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, like 
\emph on
that's
\emph default
 a big deal in the grand scheme of things,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scoffed Brooke.
 She tilted her head self-consciously.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think I'm any good at talking about the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grand scheme of things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and making it sound right.
 Corin does it better.
 Anyway, Chelsea's on our side.
 We're like cops! Magical wolf cops who stop vampires from going on huge
 rampages and turning everybody they see and destabilizing the world by
 being all chatty about it! We've already got Alpha orders from an Alpha
 no one picked because she was just born that way, and the boys have imprints
 which are totally random, there is so 
\emph on
much
\emph default
 wacky brain magic flying around in our heads that I'm glad at least 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 of it is directed by a 
\emph on
person
\emph default
 and not the 
\emph on
forces of the universe
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She frowned.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Corin does the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forces of the universe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 thing better too.
 He's got a really 
\emph on
grand
\emph default
 way of talking, you know? You'll see when you meet him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is Chelsea going to do anything to me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked nervously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Probably a little,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Brooke predicted.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, you ran away the one time, and that was really hurtful to Jacob,
 and he's important.
 So she'll want to make sure that you can be happy in the village and not
 want to run away anymore.
 But without Chelsea, you'd still have to stay in the village, you see?
 You'd just need to be under guard all the time.
 It's better her way because you get more freedom of movement.
 And maybe you wish we didn't need you, but that's not 
\emph on
Chelsea's
\emph default
 fault, it's just that Jacob imprinted on you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I don't 
\emph on
want
\emph default
 Chelsea to do anything to me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Doesn't that matter? To you or her or anyone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, you know they'll never trust you alone like that, but I guess you
 could ask,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Brooke.
 She looked like she wanted to shrug, but this might have jostled me, and
 she was keeping quite still to avoid that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How old are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, finally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fifteen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Brooke brightly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I activated three years ago.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She would have been nine or ten when the Volturi swept into La Push.
 Nine or ten when they killed her family.
 Nine or ten when they took her to Volterra.
 Nine or ten when Chelsea made her not care about who she'd lost and twisted
 her to look up to the leaders they provided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to be sick, but I can't actually throw up.
 (I tried once when I went out for brunch with a bunch of human friends
 and they all got food poisoning, except me, and I thought it was conspicuous.)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you okay, Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Brooke asked.
 She had large, dark eyes, full of concern that was probably genuine on
 some level.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did I hurt you? It's a little choppy today, usually Olivia drives the helicopter
 but she got injured in Omaha so Beatrice took her home early.

Iris, presumably nearest the food, fetched an assortment of things and I

Word from home is that you and Jacob get a suite -- two bedrooms, he insisted,
 just like Brooke's brother and his seven-year-old -- in South.
 There's plenty of extra room in the village since they were planning all
 along to have a growing population.
 So they don't even have to dig out a new home for you, which is good, because
 Addy's busy.

Carved out of bedrock, not, like, dirt.
 And we have plumbing and electricity and Internet and good ventilation,
 there's skylights in most rooms -- with one-way glass at the top, so anyone
 who wanders over us thinks there's just a lot of mirrors set into a field
 for some reason.
 I think it might be passed off as an art installation or something, actually,
 I haven't been up top to look for a placard.
 We get in through tunnels a ways from the village itself.

 I thought about ways to escape the plane.
 But even if I got away from Quinn in spite of my hurt legs and managed
 to leap out, I'd land in the ocean and eventually drown if I was left to
 my own devices.
 If I waited until we were overland, Santiago could easily follow me to

 Brooke took this opportunity to tell me the village rules.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'll probably be allowed Internet.
 Puppies aren't, except supervised in lessons, since they don't know how
 to follow the rules about being secret properly, but imprints all have
 it, but they might not be letting Claire, but you're more mature than her,
 even though you're younger.
 So you'll probably be allowed it.
 Food and your room are free, but you get some money for other stuff.
 It's in euros but you can get some of it in dollars if you want something
 from America, or whatever other kind of money if you want something from
 someplace else.
 If you want more money you can do a job.
 You probably can't be on a field team, but you could babysit or teach puppies
 their lessons or cook or run errands outside -- if they decide you're okay
 to let out, I mean, that'll probably depend -- or whatever.
 If you have a problem with anybody you're supposed to go to your alpha
 first -- but in your case that'd be Jacob so maybe he's not so impartial,
 so you might get told to go to one of the vampires first thing.

 I clarified.

They're in charge -- they take field teams out and basically run the place
 -- but I don't know about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

usually there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so much.
 They don't 
\emph on
live
\emph default
 with us, they live way down the northwest tunnel in the main compound.
 At least one of those four is there part of every day.
 And Chelsea visits once a day, during the assembly.
 You have to go to those, everybody who's home during an assembly is supposed
 to go.

Does anything happen during an assembly

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, of course,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Brooke, sounding surprised that I'd ask.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

People -- Rachel and Becky usually -- make announcements about stuff, and
 since the village was started we've come up with traditions, except I guess
 it's a little silly to call things five years old traditions, but they'll
 be traditions in like, I don't know how long it takes, fifty years? But
 there's a few people who play instruments or sing -- Gwyn dances! She got
 Santiago to teach her, Santiago is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 good but doesn't perform usually -- and sometimes they'll do that.
 And we have birthday parties if it's someone's birthday, and if somebody's
 marrying his imprint that happens during assembly too, and there's activation
 parties when a puppy gets old enough to phase.
 There was a funeral once, too,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she added soberly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Who died?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Eve Greene.
 She was one of Rachel's.
 Her brother Albert still is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Brooke.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Bad vampires killed her in the field, three years ago.
 Albert named his daughter after her when she was born last year.

Brooke's natural cheer reasserted itself after a moment, and she went on.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In South quiet hours are from ten at night to eight in the morning.
 Everybody knows English but a lot of us are at least working on Italian
 -- most of the puppies know both -- and some people have some other language,
 to get along in other countries.
 Most people do their own laundry but a couple of the puppies will do it
 for you, for pocket money, if you want.
 Huh, I don't know what else you need to know, I moved in so long ago.
 You'll pick it up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't ask her any more questions, and after a long digression about how
 she was saving up her money to buy a new loveseat for her room but might
 change her mind and blow it all on a private stash of candy instead, Brooke
 finally fell silent.

In spite of the descriptions Brooke and Quinn had provided of the village,
 I'd worked myself up to the point where I honestly expected it to be a
 forbidding and dank network of cellars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't.
 It was quite dry, and full of natural light, and while the stone itself
 was pale beige, a lot of the walls were painted -- some flat colors, some
 murals, including some that were probably by puppies.
 Most of the doors had handmade signs on them, including names -- Brooke
 pointed out her door to me on our way, and it turned out that she shared
 it with Daphne, the small wolf who'd been bitten.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You have to earn a single room,

I like Daph', but she snores.
 I roomed with Catherine before, but when Daphne activated there was a whole

Bites are

 I only got one that bad one time before, but I had a nip on my ear once

 But then Embry told me my notch was cute.

 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Even puppies with parents play there a lot of the time; they just don't
 live there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I was informed.) In the halls, coming and going every which way, were wolves,
 in and out of uniform -- there were white uniforms as well as black, which
 I guessed were linked to pack -- and in and out of fur.
 All the halls and doorways and rooms were more than spacious enough to
 fit wolves.

 Victor in deep discussion with a white-uniformed fellow, Emily carrying
 Paige into the room labeled

 They all greeted me, but didn't seem especially interested in pausing to
 chat or even asking why I was being carried.

 be retrieved and they had to make...
 some kind of alternate arrangement for Jacob.

A lot of the tour was like that, just names, cascading after each other.
 I filed them all away in my memory.
 Once I'd been introduced to the South laundry room, I asked Brooke, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How many people live here, anyway?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hmm,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's nineteen of us in Becky's pack if you don't count the wolves from
 Jacob's that we're borrowing.
 And nineteen in Rachel's, also not counting Jacob's.
 Jacob and his are eight more wolves and seven more imprints counting you,
 but Esperanza doesn't live here yet, and she might not later either, since
 they're gonna turn her but Chelsea has 
\emph on
lots
\emph default
 of work to do first, since if she wants to leave after they turn her it'd
 be

 I dunno what the plan is there.
 But let's count her.

No,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Iris and Danielle already had their kids -- one each -- before they activated.
 The imprints in our pack only have seven between them.
 Iris still lives in West with us, not in South like boys with imprints,
 but she has a room for her and her kid.
 Danielle's married to another wolf, from before activating, but he's in
 Rachel's pack so if he ever imprints there's not so much drama, and they
 live in South together.
 A couple of Rachel's other wolves had kids before too.
 Like, Shawn had two kids before he activated, and then later he imprinted
 and had two more, and Vivian has one.
 So let's see...

Ooh,

 she said, walking more briskly; she probably would have jogged if it wouldn't

 My legs were mostly healed, but I still didn't like the idea of sharp movement.

\begin_layout Standard
Rachel -- who still wore the fluffy haircut Mama had described -- announced
 that once her brother was deemed fit for duty, all of his original wolves
 would be returned to him except Zachary, whom she was retaining in her
 own pack.
 For gender balance purposes, she and Becky were each planning to transfer
 two female wolves to him; girls were invited to volunteer but would be
 chosen from on high if no one did.
 The next female activations were also planned to be assigned to Jacob.

\begin_layout Standard

For the time being,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Rachel said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

everyone will stay in the rooms they have now, although new uniforms are
 in the works -- brown, to keep up with the fur color theme.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She winked at the audience.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When things have settled down up in the compound and Addy has the time,
 she's going to carve out a new wing that we'll probably call Southeast

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Most of the white-uniformed wolves -- clustered to one side of the hall
 in which the assembly was held -- chuckled.
 Brooke pouted virtuously.
 I noted that even the people not in uniform seemed to have a lot of black
 or white in their outfits, depending.
 I wondered if I'd be going around in brown a couple of weeks later.

Then Rachel announced my presence.
 She summarized who I was --

You guys remember Bella Swan-subsequently-Cullen, right? The first wave

 There was some scattered laughter.
 I didn't know what they thought was funny.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Elspeth's her half-vampire daughter.
 She's got a long fascinating story that leads up to my baby brother imprinting
 on her, so she's one of us now.
 I expect everybody to welcome her the way we welcome every new imprint,
 and not to pester her while she's settling in.
 You can talk to anyone else in Jacob's pack and learn whatever you need
 to know -- or talk to Cody, who's bunking with his brother Seth in case
 you've forgotten.
 And Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Rachel, addressing me directly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you'll need to see Chelsea personally after assembly, okay? Okay.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I shivered, but Rachel had already moved on.
 She introduced a group of children who sang lispingly, and then it seemed
 to be over.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Brooke carried me towards the only vampire in the hall, a tall, elegant
 woman in a blue sundress.
 She had dark blonde hair with gray streaks in it at the temples, gathered
 into a ponytail -- she must have been getting on a bit by the time she
 was turned.
 Or she colored it that way on purpose.
 Or she'd grayed early.
 I didn't know why I was bothering to speculate about her hair.
 It was probably her least important feature, considering.
