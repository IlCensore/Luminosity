Siobhan didn't seem too concerned about my reply, and shrugged.

Can I assume for my purposes that you're on board with your wolf's preferences?

I guess,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I mean, what he said sounds good.

What he said includes you being happy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Maggie pointed out.

If you don't know what you want how's he going to manage that?

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, there are the obvious things.
 I wouldn't be very happy if I died or anything.
 Or if Jake did.
 But I still haven't sorted out how I feel about all the people I knew before
 I met Chelsea, and...

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan waved a hand.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right.
 I mostly just need to know what projects you will and won't help with in
 exchange for what incentives, not all the details of your psychology.
 Let me know if that changes substantially from the obvious, okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She sped up her pacing.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Are Jane and Alec loyal to Aro personally, or do they stand a substantial
 chance of defecting after Marcus learns about Didyme?

my throat is burning.
 Just my throat, though, so that's...
 better...
 but I'm so

thirsty
\shape italic

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Water,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I say, expecting a dry choking noise, but I sound like a bell.
 I think of standing, and I stand, without any time passing between the
 one and the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not water you need, dear one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 says the man.
 I recognize him.
 I've seen him before.
 He used to stand in dark places, and watch me and my brother.
 It was strange.
 What is he doing here? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not...? What happened?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Still the bell, still the thirst, what does he 
\shape default
mean
\shape italic
 water won't help? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't worry, lovely,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he says.
 He's so pale.
 I'd think he was dying if he didn't hold himself so tall.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What you need is just there.
 Help yourself.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He motions behind me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
It's some...
 people, tied up and gagged.
 Recognizing them is like trying to find something small I dropped in a
 murky lake.
 There's something off about how I remember things, but I know...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
I don't like those people.
 They're from my town.
 They didn't like me, or my brother, and they
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
I breathe in, and taste the moisture in the air, and fall on them like some
 kind of demonic creature, just like they said.
 They said me and Alec were 
\shape default
witches
\shape italic
, they said we made deals with the Devil, they said that's why I can make
 them hurt and he can make them sleep, but I never did anything with the
 Devil and neither did he...
 I think.
 It's so hard to remember.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
It tastes so good.
 The burning fades away, mostly.
 It tastes so 
\shape default
good
\shape italic
 and it makes the hurt stop.
 Water wouldn't do that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
It's over in a few seconds.
 Just a few seconds.
 I don't know how I could tell how long it took, but I could.
 And it was fast.
 
\shape default
I'm
\shape italic
 fast.
 I never was before, I never could run away when they wanted to hurt me...
 I could now.
 I could run away from anyone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
I look down at my hands.
 They have blood on them.
 And they're very, very white, where they aren't red.
 Just like the man.
 What happened to me? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
I turn around and look at him again.
 I'm fast as blinking, fast as a heartbeat.
 I don't...
 have a heartbeat anymore.

What happened to me?

Dear one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 says the man.
 He has such a nice smile.
 He likes me, I can tell, not like...
 them.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you feel?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Better.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I lick blood off my lips.
 It's so 
\shape default
good
\shape italic
.
 I tasted blood before, when they hurt me, and it didn't taste like this.
 What happened...? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
I hear somebody screaming, and turn my head that way.
 It sounds familiar, but it's hard to remember.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's your brother,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 says the man.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't worry, dear one, he'll be quite all right.
 He got a bit of a later start than you.
 His injuries were not so great as yours, and I thought perhaps he could
 be allowed to grow a bit older first.
 But he took a turn for the worse and it was necessary to intervene.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I...
 don't understand.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I touch my neck, right under my chin, where the burn is already building
 up again.
 Thirsty.
 How can I still be thirsty? My skin feels so smooth.
 I move my head and there's no hair brushing my neck.
 I have clothes on, but they're not mine, and they're too big.
 What happened to me? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What's the last thing you remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the man asks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They were saying we were...
 witches...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I whispered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They blindfolded me and I couldn't stop them, and Alec was too slow...
 and there was fire...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Witches,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 repeats the man.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Interesting.
 Dear one

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I like that he calls me that, nobody ever called me a nice nickname before,
 except when Alec calls me Sister -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am so terribly sorry that I was not able to rescue you before any of that
 happened.
 I had intended to wait until you and your twin were eighteen or so, at
 least, before I changed you.
 Unfortunately, it was only the most fortuitous coincidence that I was here
 in time to save your lives at all, and it was necessary to make you immortal
 at once to avoid losing you entirely.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You saved me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I ask.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
He nods.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're very special, you see.
 And your brother too.
 You have a unique power.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can make people hurt the way I do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I say, but he must know that, and he nods.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It didn't help.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
He smiles.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You did mention that they blindfolded you.
 You need to see who it is you mean to harm, don't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sometimes I almost thought I saw the 
\shape default
harm
\shape italic
, even.
 Like a lightning bolt.
 It used to be the best way to make people stop hurting me.
 I could make them feel it too.
 I was the one who spat out teeth and nursed cuts and limped and couldn't
 see out of swollen eyes -- but the 
\shape default
hurt
\shape italic
 I could make them feel just the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
I don't hurt now except the thirst.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
But I can remember it, the burning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dear one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 says the man, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

some people with special powers find that after they've changed, they're
 more powerful than before.
 I wonder, is there anyone you'd particularly like to try that out on? Someone
 who hurt you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He's smiling still.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't remember who...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
He leans towards me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have a power too,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he says.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With one touch, I can learn all about a person.
 When I saved you from the fire, I learned all about you, dear one.
 And I remember who it was who took you from your home to burn you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I don't think I want to remember all the things that happened before.
 I don't think I liked them very much.
 But if he remembers them, that's all right.
 He can tell me who I wanted to hurt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He smiles.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dear one, I have had my eye on you and your brother for some years.
 I was very, very angry when I found that someone had tried to do away with
 you.
 In fact, I nearly killed him.
 But then I thought, perhaps you would like him saved for you? Perhaps you
 should be the one to exact revenge? Would you like that, dear one?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is he?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I look up at the man, and he smiles and pats me on the head -- I have no
 hair at all; did the fire burn it away? Will it come back? -- and he leads
 me through the village.
 My brother screams again but we aren't going to him, we're going to hurt
 the person who hurt us.
 Nobody should hurt me, ever, and if they do, 
\shape default
they
\shape italic
 should hurt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
He's tied up and gagged, like those people I drank.
 He looks at me and he's very afraid; I see him shaking and his eyes are
 rolling in his head.
 I could kill him.
 But I don't think that would last very long.
 
\end_layout

I look him in the eye, and I share my pain

The first thing I see when I open my eyes is Jane.
 I know her immediately.

She's smiling girlishly, when I'm through and I turn around to look at her

 She looks happier than I've seen her in years.

Also loyal to Aro, but only because of Jane; if she could be pried loose
 somehow he'd follow,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Both of them were his from the start -- hasn't changed since.
 Chelsea's not under orders to make it otherwise.
 She gets her instructions from Aro and he doesn't see a reason to make
 anyone 
\shape italic
generally
\shape default
 loyal if they're already 
\shape italic
specifically
\shape default
 loyal.
 The twins 
\shape italic
like
\shape default
 everybody else in the coven, but they only answer to him.
 The closest thing to breaking away either one has ever done was when Jane
 realized that Aro's the one who turned her with all that implies, and then
 he made it up to her pretty fast by choosing that time to ask her if she'd
 knock him over just once out of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

curiosity
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 That was satisfactory to her...
 sense of justice.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 She doesn't have a phone or a regular e-mail because she never wanted anyone
 to be able to keep track of her at all.
 Her work made her accept an e-mail address, but it only takes internal
 mail, it'll reject anything from a different server

I guess on the bright side, you didn't, say, tell your dad how to get ahold

I can't see her.

But my dear, I thought that was only due to her association with the wolves,

Addy, are you finding the same difficulty?

The headache that always builds when I use Alice's precognition on anything
 difficult is forming behind my eyes; I try to ignore it and focus harder
 on the one who got away.
 In two senses of the word.
 I cannot 
\shape default
stand
\shape italic
 that Bella is still alive, that we didn't manage to kill her when it looked
 like we did.
 I've never been more frustrated in my life than when I could almost, 
\shape default
almost
\shape italic
 taste the power in that girl, 
\shape default
almost
\shape italic
 reach out and make it mine -- and find my mirror blocked completely by
 a heap of 
\shape default
rubble
\shape italic
.
 Practically no one can use their powers without the sense of location and
 lack of pain that is so neatly taken away by thorough breakage.
 Otherwise we could never have held onto a man who can 
\shape default
teleport
\shape italic
.
 Some can use their powers whatever number of pieces they find themselves
 in.
 Apparently Bella can.
 Can use it against 
\shape default
me
\shape italic
 -- that was like biting down, hard, on something that inexplicably wouldn't
 yield to my teeth.
 I almost expected my jaw to hurt, after I touched her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
I wish she'd died when we tried to kill her.
 I wish.
 I wish I could find her now, or that Alice could, so she could be hunted
 down and made to die properly this time and not go on existing as a mockery
 of my life's purpose.

But I'm not getting anything but a headache.

I can't see anything either,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I reply.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Her...
 shield might have improved recently, or it could just be a coincidence
 in the first place that she was associating with wolves regularly at the
 time it developed this aspect.

She could have found a half-vampire, besides Elspeth,

The wolves are all in the village, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Yes.
 I believe we would have other means of detecting her presence if she were
 there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Aro says dryly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Very well, I will have Joham contacted and inquire about the whereabouts
 of his daughters.
 There is no obvious way to rule out the possibility that she has located
 some other hybrid unknown to us, though.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He frowns.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Keep checking for your erstwhile sister every hour or so, please, Alice
 my dear.
 She may not keep continual company with whoever is blocking you, if indeed
 that's the case.
 It seems unlikely that she is deliberately flouting you, as she has no
 way of knowing that you are alive.

\begin_layout Standard

She did

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Aro acknowledges, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

but that could have been any number of things.
 If your head bothers you too badly, do let Alec know that he's to serve
 as your analgesic while you do your prophesying.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He pats Alice's cheek, looking avuncular, and she perks up a little at
 the opportunity to avoid the discomfort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
I have a less complicated way to avoid my headache: I take his statement
 as a dismissal, and go to the dungeon.
 It looks very empty with only Edward in it.
 I poke the heap of fragments with my foot; the headache and the flickers
 of foresight disappear and my head is filled with second sound.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Right on cue, he 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

speaks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to me, aware of the moment at which his power pushes Alice's away: 
\shape default
Please, please, don't hurt Bella, please, whatever you have to do -- you
 could credibly threaten to hurt or kill Elspeth even if Bella wouldn't
 believe you'd really kill me, she might do what you want if you try that,
 I know Aro wanted her added to the guard once, he only changed his mind
 when you couldn't -- please, please, not my Bella -

I don't have any fondness for your Bella,

 I remind him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She found a way to let down her shield for Jasper when she needed to!
\shape italic
 he tries desperately.
 
\shape default
Use Elspeth, make her do that for you too, you can get all the damn taste
 of her shield you want.
 God, she'll be furious with me for suggesting threatening her daughter,
 but Bella has to live, I spent five and a half years believing I lived
 in a world where she didn't, I can't do that again, my Bella has to live.
 Addy, you could never live with yourself if you let Bella die without trying
 as hard as you could to get the chance to copy her...
 the one power you failed to borrow when you tried...

\shape italic
 He's trying to be tantalizing, but he'd say anything if it gave his shield
 wife a better chance of survival.

I snapped myself out of the memory, unwilling to spend more time listening
 to my father trying to get me hurt so the Volturi could control my mother.
 It was strange...
 on the one hand, I didn't love him, wasn't sure I ever had, and could only
 feel so betrayed by it.
 And it should have been predictable.
 He was a vampire with a mate in danger.
 Even without Chelsea, he might have wanted to trade me in for her, although
 I wasn't sure.
 But on the other hand I'd never mentally lumped him in with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Alice can't see my mom,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At least not since the last time Addy heard anything.
 It's either something new about the shield, or my mother is spending all
 her time with a half-vampire or a wolf the Volturi don't know about.
 They got ahold of Joham and his daughters were with him and didn't know
 anything about it, and Nahuel was at home when they called and didn't know
 anything either.
 All the wolves and Cody are in the village.
 And I know it's not me.

 Jake prodded gently in a low voice.

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't feel like constructing sentences; I pushed the memory at him.
 While he processed that, Maggie said,

Well, can you think of any other place she'd get a half-vampire or a werewolf?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess there might be somebody like Embry whose mother 
\shape italic
didn't
\shape default
 move to the Quileute reservation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I speculated.
 The vampires looked at me blankly, so I explained: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Embry turned out to be a wolf, but his mother was a Makah, and everybody
 had assumed his dad was one too who she left behind.
 If she hadn't moved, Embry would be an inactive wolf on the Makah reservation
 right now and his mom would be there too, and still alive.
 There might be somebody like her, who really did stay put with her wolf
 kid; my mom would be able to tell by going to their reservation and sniffing
 around.

Augh!

 But I can't just say

oh, my father must be a horrible person then

all

 his memories up until...
 ummm, May twenty-second -- and he's a person, just a person, and he loves
 my mother so, 
\shape italic
so
\shape default
 much, and -- and -- I at least 
\shape italic
used
\shape default
 to love her, too.
 She had to make a

rule
\shape default
 for me to follow that I was

 me safe.
 I must have loved her enough to

 myself up for her once, I must have loved her enough that my dad's idea

 I don't like it, but I gave you just one second of what it felt like to

It's like after Jane burned me I wanted to do anything she said, just to
