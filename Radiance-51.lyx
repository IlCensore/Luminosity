\begin_layout Standard
When I listened at the door next to mine, Amanda was home, and had, apparently,
 kicked out Albert -- I didn't think he'd have left her of his own volition,
 but he might have slunk away if she demanded it.
 I knocked.

Go away, Albert,

 said Amanda's voice, muffled.

It's Elspeth,

There was a pause, and the door opened.
 Amanda looked at me, Jake, and Laurel wearily, and said,

I don't want to talk to all of you right now.
 Becky's already

They're just acting as my bodyguards, they don't have to say anything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I coaxed.

Will you talk to just me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amanda hesitated, and her mouth twisted in inexpressible frustration, but
 she finally stood aside and let us in.
 Jake and Laurel hung back, by the door, and I sat with Amanda at her table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Becky was here already?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, hoping to get her started talking about everything so I'd have
 a better picture of what was going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amanda nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

After I told Albert I wanted him out.
 He took Eve and he's in North with her or something, I think.
 Becky showed up on his behalf.
 I don't 
\emph on
think
\emph default
 he asked her, I think she just did it on her own, but it amounts to the
 same thing, right? One day I get 
\emph on
snatched
\emph default

\emph on
off the street
\emph default
, because my flight home was the next day and they couldn't afford to let
 him go through the motions of wooing me like the local girls got...
 and since then my life has been about being 
\emph on
Albert's imprint
\emph default
.
 As far as everybody here is concerned that justifies my existence.
 If I'd got married to a human my husband's boss wouldn't show up to tell
 me to give him a chance.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She looked at me, and sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess my next-door neighbor might either way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You didn't kidnap me.
 You were, what, three years old and looked eleven when I got gotten?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scoffed Amanda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I meant -- you were happy, weren't you, until -- recently?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess.
 Once I didn't want to go home to my family anymore I got swept up in the
 fairytale aspect.
 Magical werewolf boyfriend cannot help but love me forever and wants to
 support me while I live in a secret hamlet full of friendly folks that
 works as an arm of the freaking Illuminati? I think I spent two minutes
 thinking `wait a minute, I was going to get my master's degree starting
 this fall and be a social worker' before Chelsea saturated me with Albert-on-th
e-brain to the point where I didn't care about anything that wasn't compatible
 with staying here.
 Because of course 
\emph on
Albert
\emph default
 cannot move to suit 
\emph on
me
\emph default
, even though supposedly I'm the center of his universe, right? Albert needs
 to live with his 
\emph on
pack
\emph default

 And apparently he still does.

Do you want to go back to Canada?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked tentatively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't care if it's Canada particularly.
 I still don't really care about my relatives except that I think Eve should
 get the chance to know them, but they're scattered far and wide all over
 Ontario, so it's not like I could live near my mom 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 my dad 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 any of my siblings.
 But I want to go to school.
 And I don't want to be limited to the handful of schools that are within
 spitting distance of Nowhere, Washington, and my Italian's not good enough
 to go to a university here, and Jake's pack is attached to 
\emph on
your
\emph default
 lot and you're going to be moving all over the place, so...
 it boils down to leaving Albert, even though he's a decent guy and Eve's
 daddy who I don't particularly 
\emph on
dislike
\emph default
, even if he's no longer the end-all and be-all of my life.
 Or going `whoops, I guess I'm okay with giving up what was stolen from
 me to suit someone else's needs after all, Nowhere, 
\noun on

 be the fashion and doing nothing else with my life.

\begin_layout Standard
Amanda rolled her eyes and looked away.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Becky told me about how Rachel went to college in Spokane and it's a reasonable
 commuting distance from La Push and a good school.
 But I don't think Becky understands...
 she got married when she was eighteen to move with, I don't remember what

Caleb,

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With Caleb, to a state she'd never even visited before, and she was perfectly
 happy with that until the day she floofed for the first time.
 Becky never went to college, let alone grad school.
 Rachel went to a college that was about as far away from home as she could
 get and stay in-state, if I have the geography right.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I blurted again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Amanda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because I wasn't careful when I was deprogramming everybody...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So you're sorry for giving me my brain back because now I'm going to make
 things inconvenient?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said snappishly, and I cringed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry because you're unhappy and I think it's my fault.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amanda frowned, and sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I still love Albert,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, sounding uncertain, but then she shook her head to clear it and
 repeated herself more confidently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't love him more than anything else in the world anymore, that's all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I bit my lip carefully, then said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 each pack have to stay together, anyway?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you asking 
\emph on
me
\emph default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Amanda wanted to know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jake,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake coughed into his hand.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Um,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

It mostly just seems right.
 I mean, before the massacre we were all in La Push.
 Now some of us have reason to be elsewhere, but we can still be elsewhere
 in groups.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It mostly just seems right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repeated Amanda, putting incredulous pauses between the words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, that, and we kind of have a culture...
 and Eve ought to have it too,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake added.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you went to school in Boston or something and had Albert and Eve with
 you, Eve wouldn't grow up like a puppy, really.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Won't she pick it up quick enough once she's activated? 
\emph on

 she's activated?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 challenged Amanda.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're telepathic!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is that you'd want to do, 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
, if Albert could follow you anywhere?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, my brain working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd apply to a bunch of grad schools and pray one would take me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Amanda.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Spin the time I've spent here as a long gap `year' that only incidentally
 involved getting married and having a baby.
 Mostly I'd look for schools in Ontario, I guess, but I'd need to do some
 research, see what places are ranked well for social work programs...
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

My mom is planning to put one of her regional capitals in QuÃ©bec, but hadn't
 picked an exact site last I checked,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you were at school in the part of Ontario that's near it, and the capital
 weren't too far away, and Albert were in Jake's pack instead of Becky's,
 Albert could do some job at the capital.
 Keeping it partly open even when the rest of us are elsewhere, maybe.
 It sounded to me like my mom's eventual plan was to have them all staffed
 full time and she just doesn't quite have the numbers to do it yet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I could even see asking a few other wolves to stay there full time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake volunteered.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Especially a couple of them who sort of wanted to adopt orphans, but haven't
 because they didn't think it would be good to bounce them around that much
 and they also wanted to stick with being professional werewolves.
 Laurel?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Laurel, not relaxing her attentive posture, but there was a hint of
 something in her eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And maybe Nina and Calvin, too,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If this were an option we might even keep some currently planning to go
 with other packs.
 Like the Delaneys, and possibly Vivian and Iris, they're mostly staying
 here in the village because they have kids -- but they don't have imprints,
 so they aren't tied here by anybody's family relationships, the way the
 guys with Italian wives or the ones who imprinted back in the States are
 to Volterra or La Push.
 There really isn't 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 strong a reason to keep the pack all geographically together.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So QuÃ©bec can be permanently open and the others can rotate until there's
 the numbers to keep them all running full time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If my mom goes for it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mom went for it.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can gradually add permanent populations to capitals one at a time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And may as well start with QuÃ©bec if that would be convenient.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But not before exasperatedly ranting that the wolves certainly had not
 behaved as though splitting up packs was an option back when they were
 staying up all night arguing about where to go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake called in Daphne to take over his bodyguard post for a couple of hours,
 so he could go alert everyone to the change of circumstance and invite
 everyone to make new arrangements in response.
 I whiled away the evening in the company of both wolf girls, telling them
 about Esme's architectural plans and my job in the 
\noun on
prpr
\noun default
 department and similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Would you have wanted someone to adopt you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked Daphne, during a lull in the conversation, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if this had all happened three or four years ago?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Daphne was the second-youngest wolf, thirteen to newly-active Ashleigh's
 twelve, and had spent the early years of the wolves' time in the village
 as one of the orphans in North.
 I knew she considered herself an adult upon first phasing, and no one had
 seriously suggested that the active wolves close to her age needed adopting,
 but she'd have a perspective on the matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
 She didn't elaborate immediately, but when neither I nor Laurel said anything
 to move the attention away from her, she went on.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At first there were only the three kids in the village with parents, and
 they were little and I didn't think much about them, but they got older
 and I could sort of see how having a family instead of just being another
 Northie would be nice.
 And then guys started imprinting and having puppies and that looked nice
 too.
 We were taken care of and everything.
 But it was like we came in clumps to the people who looked after us, because
 there were so many.
 I was the middle of the Gwyn-Daphne-Ashleigh clump because we were girls
 around the same age.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded.
 I glanced at Laurel, and considered asking who she was thinking of adopting,
 but decided that she'd probably consider it unprofessional to discuss it
 on duty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evening came, and Laurel and Daphne were replaced by Kelly and Gregory,
 and I slept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next day there was another family.
 I was beginning to get the hang of explaining things, and managed to keep
 them all relatively calm while explaining what had happened to their daughter/s
ister/wife/mother (the woman's children were both grown, thankfully; I wasn't
 looking forward to talking to Benito's little boy).
 They unanimously wanted me to try 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

option one
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- pushing their memories of their lost relative at her in the hopes that
 she'd wake up and behave something like herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy handled that, since there was some chance that if she composed the
 requisite summary, it would borrow intensity from her vampire mind that
 I couldn't offer.
 She read all the relatives, then borrowed my power, took a couple of minutes
 to extract the relevant portions of memory, and hit the patient with it
 all in one go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing happened.
 Addy reached into her pocket, which contained the dying piece of Aro.
 She tapped the woman on the forehead, and frowned.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Didn't stick,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she reported gravely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Try it again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She did, and she tried sending the summary to me so we could both blast
 the patient simultaneously, and we tried it while holding a mirror in front
 of the patient's eyes, but to no avail.
 She didn't react, and each time Addy checked, the information had slid
 out of her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The family was disappointed, and there were tears, but they seemed understanding
 that we were not (quite) miracle-workers.
 (It probably helped that, again, they didn't know that Addy was responsible,
 and seemed to be under the impression that it had been a complete accident.
 This was close enough -- since Addy hadn't set out to hurt the humans --
 that Magic only itched me a little.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After much discussion, a little bickering, but no yelling at all, the family
 determined that their mnemically overloaded member was dead, and their
 choices boiled down to sustaining her as a confused vegetable or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

donating her body to science".
 It turned out that she'd been intending to do the latter anyway, albeit
 in a far more conventional fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We wound up with the green light to turn her into whoever we thought best,
 if we could, and no interest in putting that new person into contact with
 her new genetic relatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now all we have to do is decide who, and hope it works.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think we also need to call the brothers' family, so they know that one
 of the choices on the table doesn't work,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll do it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, snagging my power again and pulling out her phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thanks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and went (with Jake and Aaron following me) to see what my mom
 was up to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mom was contemplating how to deploy her forces to not only spread the
 news, but also the enforcement, about the new vegetarian regime to the
 world.
 Vampires tended to be at least peripherally aware of other nearby vampires,
 and so some word of mouth would do some of the work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peter and Charlotte had been called and were telling their neighbors, and
 between them and the Denalis (all of whom had gone home), the whole of
 North America might be expected to have the information inside of a month.
 Britain's vampires were well-informed and could communicate with counterparts
 on the European mainland.
 Sukutai and her mate had gone home to central Africa, as was Abdelmajid
 to Morocco; Benjamin and Tia knew a few covens and individuals on the continent
 too, although they were in more regular contact with the Middle East.
 Kachiri and Senna (who had not been able to convince their erstwhile sister
 to leave with them, and had eventually decided to join the Golden Coven
 rather than be permanently parted from her), plus Nahuel and Huilen, could
 cover South America.
 And so on.
 We had access to representatives of most regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But many vampires lived isolated lives and didn't welcome contact with others,
 and it wasn't that hard for one willing to accept an undesirable territory
 to go for centuries without meeting anyone.
 Nearest neighbors might be unaware of their existence.
 They would be harder to find.
 And every week that went by without their being reached and converted or
 contained meant human deaths.
 My mother appeared to view her having delayed as long as she had to be
 a considerable tragedy, but said that there was an unacceptable disadvantage
 to making decrees before the ability to enforce them caught up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nathan was key to her strategy for handling the matter, although she still
 grudgingly accepted that it could take years or decades before everyone
 knew about the Golden Coven the way everyone had known about the Volturi.
 Nathan, in his capacity as the Imperial Minister of Temporal Affairs, or
 Addy with his power, could coordinate with Razi or Alice -- our two ways
 to figure out what was going on far away.
 He did so by suggesting the correct moments to look in on a list of locations.
 (Nathan's power only told him when it was best for 
\emph on
him
\emph default
 to do various things, but saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to an ally to get an outcome he wanted counted as him doing something,
 so indirectly, he could combine his witchcraft with others.) They were thereby
 working, bit by bit, through areas of the world that weren't claimed by
 known vampires who'd hear the news through the grapevine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Razi and Alice could then both double as messengers, and there was a written
 summary of the new order hanging on the wall of the throne room that Alice
 had, so far, shown to four people.
 Razi had visited only two (one of whom had attempted to kill him, to his
 amusement).
 He was going slower than Alice since his mechanism of sharing involved
 actually having conversations and took longer, but my mother planned to
 get pamphlets printed up for him to distribute so as to speed up the process.
 Once those were handy, Alice would switch over to a pure surveillance role
 to make sure that the new rules were being 
\emph on
followed
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice was the first to admit that she certainly could not keep a constant
 watch on everybody.
 However, she could check the few thousand eyes' colors that would need
 monitoring each once a week (contact lenses were easy enough for vampire-qualit
y vision to notice, and a week wasn't enough time for animal blood to completely
 cover up a tasty transgression) and then anyone who was misbehaving could
 receive more personal attention.
 (Sukutai, the camouflage witch, was the only person who would be able to
 thwart the eye check, since her color adjustments were much more unobtrusive
 than contacts when she wanted them to be.
 But she'd seemed sincere about being willing to go along with the new governmen
t when inspected, or she wouldn't have been released in the first place.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This personal attention would mostly come in the form of Razi, again, who
 was muttering to himself about how much work he was getting.
 He could deliver warnings without fearing retribution, and he was also
 willing to be the executioner when called for (by incorrigible offenders,
 or anyone who was caught in the very middle of something untoward).
 Intermediate cases -- where someone had just slipped up or broken some
 more minor rule -- were to be punished by assorted sentences of hiding.
 Pera was grudgingly willing to temporarily loan a little finger or a toe
 to Addy, when called for, so that Addy could teleport with Razi's power,
 hide the offender with Pera's, and then teleport home again (either via
 Razi coming to pick her up, or via a similar loan from him).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mother was somewhat concerned that Addy, equipped with pieces of Razi
 and Pera both, would be able to run rampant should she so choose without
 my dad being in range to detect the intention, but it was ultimately concluded
 that the team of Alice, Pera, and Razi would be able to take her down within
 a few tries if that occurred.
 Addy didn't seem offended by the suspicion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy couldn't hide witches, so Pera herself would need to travel on the
 occasions that transgressors were gifted.
 But the general population of vampires included comparatively few witches
 and the Volturi had snapped up most of the more powerful, so this wasn't
 expected to be a frequent occurrence.
 Alice would spend a little time hiding every week, too, from which vantage
 point she'd be able to check on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

prisoners
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and make sure they weren't causing what trouble they could.
 Misbehaving significantly, or after a warning, from the hiding place was
 going to have to carry a death penalty.
 Everything else one could do to prevent a vampire from misbehavior took
 too many personnel-hours (especially since my mom wanted Alec working in
 
\noun on
prpr
\noun default
, anesthetizing turning vampires) or was also torture.
 Keeping vampires in bits, while theoretically feasible, had been shown
 to be impractical over the course of recent events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What seemed to make my mom even more uncomfortable than the prospect of
 the rampant use of the death penalty was the fact that she couldn't see
 a way around punishing mates together.
 She could leave the innocent mate of an offending vampire alive, but that
 wasn't particularly 
\emph on
merciful
\emph default
, and was not likely to encourage the living partner to remain innocent,
 either.
 I was pretty sure she was thinking in particular of Irina and Laurent.

If someone is disturbed by the possibility of mating to someone who doesn't

 my mother suggested.

That should be easier now that no one is supposed to be eating humans, and

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ideally,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we would catch the perpetrator while the victim was still in the middle
 of turning, and hide the perp, leaving the victim free.
 I think the evidence we have available suggests that the victim won't mate
 to their creator until and unless they 
\emph on
see
\emph default
 them, which hiding prevents.
 That way the victim wouldn't be punished, and the hidden mate would, quite
 tidily.
 If,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she sighed, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

we

 catch them in time, then there's no clever trick up my sleeve, I fear.

So the sentence will have to be good and
