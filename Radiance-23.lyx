I might as well make the best of this unfortunate meeting.
 Damn my greed! Damn Jane and that 
\shape default
delicious
\shape italic
 weapon she wields, that irresistible power pouring off of her so enticingly
 that I left my safety.
 It wasn't worth the taste.
 But Aro's nearly as appealing...
 I want to see what that flavor is like.
 I'm too insatiably curious; it'll be the death of me one of these years.
 The only saving grace is that they don't know exactly what I can do yet.
 So far as he knows, I'm another Jane, a second lash of fire to tuck into
 his arsenal.
 He doesn't know what he'll give me when I touch his hand.
 So I do.

I glance at the vampire world's three kings and two queens, once Aro releases

 Why are there only two queens? Aro must know, and now so do I.

My sister's magic is worthless.
 Absolutely worthless.
 Worse, she herself is not the stabilizing factor for Marcus that my precious
 Sulpicia is to me, or Athenodora to Caius.
 Our wives will be queens; they long for it.
 His wife would rather be a bit of dandelion fluff, floating about the world
 trailing her absurd aura of happiness after her and taking her mate along
 at the expense of my every ambition.
 Chelsea, prize though she is, essential scissor and spinner, would not
 long manage a large coven working blind.
 Weaknesses she could not see would grow on the insides of those threads
 she pulls.
 Attractions too wispy for her to catch alone would form to external, unwelcome
 persons.
 We would fall apart.
 That cannot happen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marcus is essential; Didyme threatens his role; Didyme must go.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do love my sister.
 I could arrange to fix that now, but I shouldn't like Chelsea to, upon
 later finding a mate of her own, abscond with him in the night in fear
 of my doing him harm.
 Not that I wouldn't do him harm, if he occupied Didyme's wretched position
 in the same story re-enacted with my very necessary dear Chelsea.
 But I wouldn't like her 
\shape italic
anticipating
\shape default
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, loving Didyme, I must nonetheless do away with her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poor sister.
 If only Marcus were willing to help Chelsea in working with you, that you
 could be more tightly bound to us.
 If only Marcus painted for you a more lovely picture of the sovereignty
 we will share, that you might know some fraction of our aspirations in
 your own heart.
 If only Marcus had more force of personality, that you would have been
 swayed by his dreams instead of he by yours.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will be my mercy to him, that he will never learn that he could have
 saved you.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You are easily led away.
 You trust me now the way you trusted me when I judged you old enough and
 ready to be one of us.
 Then, I suppose it hurt for longer than it will today.
 (I will make your death instant if I can.) But you walked away from the
 first

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, as I meant you to do.
 I did want to see what ability you might turn up with.
 Magic may run in the blood, but capriciously, clearly -- your power is
 only hastening your death, chasing away my apprehensions at destroying
 you and replacing them with indifferent euphoria.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You are easily led, and easily secluded, and easily killed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I read your last thoughts, one more day of them to pile on since the last
 time I embraced you, and you do not even realize what I have done.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A coven of two is nearby.
 They will deny everything.
 Of course.
 That would be only natural; what else would they do? I'll take their thoughts,
 declare them guilty, Marcus and I will fall upon them in revenge -- oh,
 lost sister, if it had been those who took your life I truly would kill
 them in revenge! -- and Chelsea will do her work.
 Marcus will be on hand to help her.

Ah, beloved sister.
 We will build such a kingdom.
 Your sacrifice will be not in vain -

Aro is looking at me with considerable interest.
 I produce what I hope is a beatific smile, and catch his hand again.
 
\shape default
I know,
\shape italic
 I think at him, knowing quite well that he'll listen to my new thoughts
 when I try to communicate like this, 
\shape default
something that you wouldn't like me to say aloud.
 But there is no reason for us to be enemies.
 Why don't we see what we can work out that suits the both of us?

 I glance speculatively at Caius and his Athenodora.
 Then over at lonely Marcus.

Aro, to his credit, does not let the mask of cordial, fascinated pleasure

That's what Aro didn't want Addy to tell anyone,

 Aro killed her.

He did?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Siobhan, sounding mildly stunned.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's...
 It would certainly 
\shape italic
fracture

 the Volturi if they all knew.
 I'm not sure if it would actually destroy them for that to get out; a lot
 of the guard are loyal to Aro personally, aren't they?

\begin_layout Standard

 How badly does Chelsea need Marcus?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How much can she do on her own, given the scenario where he makes a fuss,
 gets himself killed, and no one else wants to make a commotion about it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Every time somebody's managed to leave the Volturi it's been when or just
 after Marcus was called away for a long time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I murmured, thinking of Eleazar's departure with Carmen and a few similar
 cases.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When he and Aro and Caius all go off to deal with something in the field,
 even if Chelsea stays home, somebody can break loose.
 Usually they let them -- they never wanted to make it really obvious that
 joining them is supposed to be a one-time decision.
 I'm not sure how long it would take for it to fall apart more deeply than
 that...
 Give me a minute.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I closed my eyes and spun through moments Memory presented as representative:
 Eleazar and Carmen extending their regrets to Aro and striking off on their
 own; Chelsea listening to Marcus say that she could handle the villagers
 without him because there were no vampires in it, and eventually compromising
 on a bimonthly schedule; Marcus watching the coven move about the compound
 with brilliant trails of light connecting them in myriad colors rich with
 meaning, but always returning his eyes to the shredded white ribbon that
 should have stretched from him to Didyme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at Marcus's memories since her death was 
\shape italic
painful
\shape default
.
 He was always staring at that ribbon.
 Even if his eyes pointed some other direction, even if he was trying to
 concentrate on someone's gleaming ultraviolet enmity or dimming particolored
 friendship, the torn pale half of a mate bond had some corner in his vision
 and more than that of his attention.
 On the rare occasions he managed to really think about something else,
 it would twist as though ruffled by a breeze, and he'd be drawn right back
 into grief.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked back farther, to before he'd met her, trying to get accustomed
 to what his power did and figure out how heavily Chelsea depended on it.
 The difference was palpable.
 Marcus had apparently always been melancholy and a little inclined to brood,
 but he'd been 
\shape italic
distractable
\shape default
 before Didyme entered and exited his life.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the streams of light that he saw between people were excellent distractions.
 They were endlessly fascinating, supernally beautiful, flecked and striped
 and inscribed with every possible color and intensity and shape.
 He hadn't originally known what the features of the relationships he saw
 
\shape italic
meant
\shape default
, and had to learn them the way he'd learned to read.
 But a vampire brain and lifespan (and some work with Aro, who could, given
 time and the chance to touch the people involved, confirm or deny Marcus's
 hypotheses) afforded him plenty of opportunity to figure out the code.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marcus could see both directions of a relationship as long as one person
 was within sight and the other within range of the first, that range proportion
al to the strength of a relationship.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mate bonds, he could see no matter how far apart the mates were.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He'd seen his and Didyme's ribbon snap and her half evaporate.
 He'd been staring right at it when she died.
 I flinched away from that memory and went earlier again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The white ribbons that represented mate bonds were unusual in their color,
 but also their simplicity.
 Usually, mates had the ribbon and then separate, more multicolored beams
 to display anything else they shared on top of that.
 It was those intricate ones he read for anything complex...

Hello.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I don't need to open my eyes to look her up and down; the light is bright
 enough to my extra sight even through my eyelids, and the light is more
 important than what sort of nose she has or anything of that nature.
 The light...
 is lurching unnaturally.

Chelsea, if you don't stop that I'm going to kill you.

 It's a poor lie.
 But she does stop.
 The light stills, except for a perfectly natural shimmer of yellow in reaction
 to my threat.

Aro laughs at us.

Brother, I think she's worth more alive than dead.

Aro -- Master Aro, I mean -- said that you see them.
 More clearly than I can feel them.

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And you can't affect your relationships...
 or not the halves of them that exist in your mind, anyway.
 Can you even tell they're there? Untidy, conflicted mess.
 And it's obvious.
 You couldn't have been an immortal for forty-three years and still be nursing
 anything like that little love-hate relationship with your...
 father, yes, that'll be him, I've never seen that shade of mauve anywhere
 else.
 It would have dimmed by now if you'd been among us long, or brightened
 if he'd turned too.
 But no, there it is.
 He was hard on you, and you resent him, but at the same time you haven't
 killed him yet -- probably can't make up your mind -- you admit he was
 instrumental in making you who you are and...
 Is he looking after your...
 niece? You've a dead sister who left a daughter behind?

I wouldn't have seen the bit about your family if we weren't in their town.

\begin_layout Standard

I don't care,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I say.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why do you think I would?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 There's a lot of dark green speckled with clusters of pale pink specks
 there, glowing erratically -- she's impressed with me.
 In spite of herself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
She starts to smile, just a little.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She was like me, or close to it.
 When Master Aro explained what he wanted of me I decided that she had to
 die.
 I don't want to outlive my value.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That explains the brown patterning on their relationship.
 I'm starting to think it's characteristic of Aro, to back people into such
 corners so they need to resort to more drastic securing of their positions
 than they would normally bother with.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't know.
 You're right, I can't feel detail at all.
 I can't see what I'm doing, let alone what she was doing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She swallows, sways a little, and a cyan wire wraps around our shared strand
 of light.
 Supplication.
 She acknowledges me as an authority -- albeit not as much as she does Aro
 -- and she has some hope that I'll be a benevolent one.

Marcus is good,

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's 
\shape italic
really
\shape default
 good, when he's on his game.
 Chelsea's learned in her millennia, but she still needs his help for anything
 that will hold up for long.
 I'm not 
\shape italic
sure
\shape default
, but I give it maybe a month or two without Marcus's help before the Volturi
 start fragmenting into more normal-sized covens and individuals -- some
 of them probably fighting each other before scattering -- even if none
 of the others were particularly upset over Didyme.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I shook my head in disbelief.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't realize while I was there what a big deal he is, because he didn't
 come to the village much.
 But the village is wolves and humans, not vampires -- way better suited
 to living in big groups.
 Vampires don't usually hang out in bunches of more than, like, four or
 five at a time, if they aren't vegetarian.

I hate it that they ever did that to

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said stiffly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyway.
 Now that Marcus has the memories -- I think he does, anyway, he was probably
 close enough to get caught in the blast -- he 
\shape italic
will
\shape default
 eventually find out how Didyme died.
 The only reason he might not realize it immediately is that 
\shape italic
she
\shape default
 didn't know, and if I were him I'd look at her own memories first, not
 at Aro or the coven he pinned her death on.
 That means that the Volturi are either going to fall apart -- eventually
 -- or get Addy back in the coven.
 Unless they find another way to replace Marcus or get a better version
 of Chelsea before they splinter.

Which doesn't seem likely,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Siobhan, although she was looking at me for confirmation.
 I had the strange sensation that I had somehow turned into an 
\shape italic
authority figure
\shape default
, which made me feel a little like I was perched somewhere very high, and
 also liable to fall off of it at any time.
 I like attention.
 I don't have any experience with

 I said.

There was Chelsea's cousin but she died thousands of years ago.
 They haven't found anyone with a similar power to her or Marcus since,
 that they know about.
 And they went back to Chelsea's hometown a couple decades later and checked
 out the rest of her family just in case, too.
 Chelsea didn't like that.
 But they didn't find anything.

Siobhan nodded.

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So the Volturi are either doomed, or they're going to get Addy back, or
 something very unlikely is going to happen -- but even doomed they can
 be very destructive on the way down -- and then what? They haven't been
 doing an admirable job 
\shape italic
lately
\shape default

\shape italic
did
\shape default
 keep our species in check for a couple millennia.
 The threat of them, and their actual enforcement when a problem cropped
 up.

 said Siobhan.

As the news gets out we'll have immortal children and newborn armies and
 daywalking and uncovered feeding.
 Humans have been able to kill us given sufficient dedication and numbers
 since they discovered fire -- nowadays, I give it six months or less between
 our existence being public knowledge, and them developing some contraption
 that will let them kill us as easy as we kill them or they kill each other.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Maggie.

There are a lot of covens who would just 
\shape italic
love
\shape default
 to turn the first couple dozen people they see and train them up into an
 army and send them after their enemies.
 It's happened.
 Within my lifetime, even, though I've never seen it.
 I 
\shape italic
have
\shape default
 personally seen a woman who desperately wanted an immortal child and 
\shape italic
only
\shape default
 didn't go kidnap someone's primary schooler and turn him because she knew
 the Volturi would find out sooner or later and kill them both.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 She shuddered, probably thinking of Molly.

I

Given any thought to the thing where humans might not

 to kill you if you didn't treat them like snacks?

It's crossed my mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Siobhan gravely, giving him a chastising look.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do you think 
\shape italic
you
\shape default
 could turn into an enormous fanged creature in the middle of this city
 and be welcomed as a harmless puppy if you took care to mention that you
 don't dine on humans? Do you really think that I could swear off human
 blood this hour and be acknowledged thereafter as a valuable member of
 society who they shouldn't burn to ashes?

 She aimed her thumb at Ilario.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This fellow hasn't eaten anyone in his

 He's still a vampire.
 He'll be tarred with the same brush as any of us.
 Humans.
 Are.
 
\shape italic
Stupid.

\shape default
 They're stupid in different 
\shape italic
ways
\shape default
 than vampires -- you can't, for instance, predict what a human is going
 to do based on the information that he or she is married, and can't expect
 that all of their large-scale alliances will fall apart without magical
 help.
 But they are still

stupid

 Jake asked, troubled.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan eyed me consideringly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Safer than me, probably safer than you.
 She looks cute and harmless, doesn't turn into anything more intimidating,
 she's never killed anybody and she can 
\shape italic
prove
\shape default
 it just by saying so...
 all things considered I think she could be okay in a world without our
 secrets.
 Anyway.
 It's 
\shape italic
everyone's
\shape default
 problem if the Volturi collapse, which is now a very, very serious risk.
 That should help with collecting help, at least.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She started pacing again, having paused in place while I wasn't paying
 attention.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I feel like I should ask,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Maggie said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Siobhan, are actually going to 
\shape italic
help
\shape default
 us, or do you still want to stay out of it like you told Carlisle?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ilario dryly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

a coherent

\shape default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan frankly, seeming to cover both questions with one response.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll admit: my priority is the status quo on this island.
 Ireland is mine.
 It's been mine for centuries.
 I'm not ready to give it up.
 I'm also not convinced that the Volturi being completely dismantled would
 be a good thing, although the aforementioned status quo does depend on
 their witch collection project being toned 
\shape italic
way down
\shape default
 before they find out I exist -- which is as inevitable as Marcus finding
 out who killed his wife.
 What do 
\shape italic
you
\shape default
 lot want?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I blinked rapidly, reminded uncannily of my mother, though she and Siobhan
 looked nothing alike.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It would help if I knew where we can cooperate before trying to work out
 how we're going to do that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was looking at everybody but Liam, and none of us seemed to know who
 should go first.
 Finally Maggie said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I want my family safe.
 Molly needs a stable place to grow up, and Gianna and I need a stable place
 to raise her.
 And Ilario.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ilario looked amused by this comment, so I guessed that it might be some
 kind of in-joke between him and Maggie rather than real dismissal.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Similar here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maggie, you might want to remember that the Volturi tried to have Gianna
 killed, back when.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right, I don't like them much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 agreed Maggie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But they didn't succeed.
 If they're some kind of necessary evil for letting us bring up Molly without
 incident, I'll put up with them existing.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld

One sec,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I murmured, and I turned around to put my hands back on Jake's face and
 repeat the deprogramming trick with all the other Volturi.
 After I thought I'd been as thorough with each of them as I had been with
 Chelsea, I dropped my arms to my sides.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Jake made a weird nauseated face.

 He glanced around at the vampires, all waiting for him to finish uttering
 the slur.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

...ders of the supernatural world

 I guess some of the guard could get moved into a new administration or
 something, that's a lot of maybe-potentially-good witches to toss after
 the bad, but it can't go on like this.
 I want the wolves independent of or at least equal to the vampires, not
 a private conscript army.
