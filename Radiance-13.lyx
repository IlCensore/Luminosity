Chelsea wasn't done with me immediately.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

snip snip
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 part was fast -- bolstering the relationships she 
\emph on
wanted
\emph default
 me to have took longer.
 Brooke stood patiently, cradling me, while I tried to rally my scattered
 thoughts and think of something to 
\emph on
do
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seeds.
 Chelsea needed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
seeds
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 to do any more damage, to work in the opposite direction -- and why hadn't
 I felt anything, surely this should 
\emph on
feel like something
\emph default
 -- where did I hear the thing about seeds? That didn't matter, I'd heard
 it, it felt like reliable information.
 But what counted as a seed? If I felt sorry for Brooke, would that be enough
 for Chelsea to make me think Brooke was my best friend whose loyalties
 I should adopt as my own and who I couldn't bear to betray? If I missed
 Cody, was that enough for her to erase the notion that there had been anything
 about his abandoning the free pack I should disapprove of? Just how did
 she 
\emph on
work
\emph default
? How did I make the seeds go away, if I even could? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It still didn't feel like anything.
 I couldn't even tell what was happening, or how quickly, or where it was
 too late and where I still had a chance to interfere if that was even possible.
 Chelsea just looked at me with that unchanging, soft smile, and murmured
 inanities about how Jacob and I would be responsible for keeping our suite
 clean, and how I could submit requests to the cafeteria staff if I wanted
 specific dishes, and how I was to be allowed internet but would need to
 pay for a computer on my own if I didn't want to borrow other people's...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of minutes went by with this one-sided small talk.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think that will do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Chelsea said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To begin with, at least.
 Brooke can take you to Jacob.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did want to see Jacob.
 I felt bad about running off without him.
 He had to have been out of his mind with worry, and while I felt helpless
 in a lot of ways, I knew I was the only person qualified to make him feel
 better.
 Brooke smiled at Chelsea, then ducked her head politely -- I had the impression
 that she'd have bowed, if she hadn't been trying to carry me comfortably
 -- and turned to take me back to South from the assembly room.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you think he'll be awake?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked Brooke.
 We turned into the hall where my and Jacob's suite was.
 We were right next to Quil and Claire on one side, and Albert Greene --
 the one whose sister had died -- and his imprint and daughter on the other.
 Across the hall were Jared and Kim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By now, if he's not awake yet, you can wake him.
 Can you get the door? My hands are full,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she teased, and I reached out and turned the handle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door opened into a small living space, with more doors leading to a
 bathroom and two bedrooms.
 All the doors were open, and I could see Jacob, sprawled sleeping on top
 of a crazy-quilt.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jacob?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bwuh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He yawned hugely and opened his eyes, then broke into a huge grin.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He hauled himself to his feet and walked around the little table in the
 living area, but then brought himself up short.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why is Brooke carrying you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I decided that no good could come of setting him at Santiago's throat.
 If nothing else, he'd get torn to bits if he tried to go after her for
 revenge.
 I didn't expect it to happen again and I was nearly healed, anyway.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There was a fight.
 I got in the way, and my legs were hurt, but they're almost set right.
 I should be walking just fine in the morning,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, which was all true and would probably not get anyone killed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here, you can hold her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Brooke offered, and Jacob carefully transferred me from her arms to his.
 I thanked her, and she smiled at me perkily and left us alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How're you doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jacob asked, softly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I sighed a deep sigh.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's been a very long ten days.
 I guess it should calm down from here, shouldn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It did.

\begin_layout Standard
The next day was the first of June.
 When I woke up, I tentatively put weight on one foot, then the other, and
 found myself in normal working order.
 Jacob was still asleep.
 In fact, everyone was still asleep, with the probable exception of Cody.
 I let myself out of the suite and wandered the halls.
 It was peaceful, although I got lonely soon after leaving the suite.
 Not wanting to be alone, nor inclined to wake anybody up, I veered over
 to East in case Cody was out of his and Seth's room.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wasn't when I passed the door, but it opened in response to my footfalls
 and Cody stepped out.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought that might be you, O world's most interesting half-vampire,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said softly, and then he smiled and held his arms forth for a hug.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hugged him readily.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good morning,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is there for early birds to do around here?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cody showed me where in the cafeteria the midnight snacks were kept.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But if you can, it'd be a good idea to start actually eating three meals
 a day,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A lot of the social life around here seems to happen at mealtimes, which
 feels weird to me even though I know it's perfectly ordinary, because we
 didn't usually have 
\emph on
meals
\emph default
 back when we were meandering around in the hiding place.
 So far all I've managed is to eat light when I wake up and then eat again
 at lunchtime, but I'm working on it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nibbled on fruit and crackers to imitate this pattern; he'd already had
 his breakfast, but sat with me and talked about being with his siblings
 again.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I got older, and I look like I got more older than I did,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he laughed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They look exactly the same as they did when I left -- well, maybe Seth is
 a little more filled out now.
 But sometimes Leah'll call me 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cody-kiddo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or Seth'll pull a goofy face, and it's like I'm a month old again asking
 for wolf rides.
 Got one, too, for old time's sake, my second day here.
 Seth careened through the halls like somebody set his fur on fire and this
 could be solved by running very fast.
 Public safety warning: being on fire cannot be solved by running very fast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I giggled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you doing any of the jobs?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, actually, or -- sort of,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's unconventional...
 I'm now the designated guy-who-turns-people-who-need-turning.
 Vampires have 
\emph on
way
\emph default
 more trouble than we do controlling themselves around blood.
 Even old, well-fed vampires, compared to halfsies even just my age or yours,
 are a little more likely to bite and then 
\emph on
swallow
\emph default
.
 So it's safer to have me do the job.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Really?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, I'm kidding,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, grinning at me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Silly goose -- they're all about the highly medicalized turnings now, syringes
 and whatnot.
 Plus I'm not sure I'd like to be the one to chomp Pera and she's next on
 the docket.
 Her and Brady are actually 
\emph on
in
\emph default
 the compound right now.
 They aren't taking any chances.
 She's really important.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where are they going to live after she turns?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think that's been decided yet.
 I guess she'll probably hang around here part of every day -- maybe even
 help run the village -- but sometimes, especially when Brady's asleep I
 bet, she'll be up in the compound with the other vampires.
 I guess it depends on how her turning affects the imprint, though.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You think it would?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Might.
 I don't think any werewolf would imprint on a vampire in the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 place, you know? Given that they supposedly imprint on people who'll be
 able to have their kids?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 His sentence lost some of its momentum in the last clause, and he gave
 me an awkward look.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It turns out half-vampires can have kids, actually,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At least with vampires or humans.
 Noemi has at least one kid, with a vampire dad.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, huh,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you only know about the one kid of hers, how do you know that humans
 can work as the other parent?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I blinked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I just heard it somewhere.
 And it makes sense, doesn't it? Anyway, 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 you doing a job? Since you're 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the official venom dispenser?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've thought about it.
 Leah's a beta, and Seth's not imprinted so he's one of the tunnel guards,
 keeping an eye out for humans who find their way in through one of the
 entrances.
 So they both work, but I don't know what I want to do, and it's not like
 I 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to get a job if I don't want.
 I can just live off the state,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he added with a roguish wink.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Retire at age five.
 What about you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have the impression that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

imprint
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is actually considered a job all by itself, but as for what I'll 
\emph on
do
\emph default
, I don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess I'll settle in and see if I naturally fall into anything.
 Maybe something with the children.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't call them that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 advised Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They think 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

child
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is only for young 
\emph on
humans
\emph default
, and they'll be insulted and correct you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He imitated one of them: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not a 
\emph on
child
\emph default
! Childs grow up and be 
\emph on
humans
\emph default
 but I'm 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 gonna be one of those, I'll be a 
\emph on
wolf
\emph default
, so I'm a puppy, okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Dropping the impression, he said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A couple imprints are holding out on the terminology, but the ones who are,
 all speak Italian most of the time, so they don't even use the exact word
 `child'.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Bambini
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I informed him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right.
 I'm working on Italian, a little.
 You 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 get along with just English, in the village -- not that 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 need to, polyglot whiz.
 There's only four Italian imprints, and the puppies are all being brought
 up bilingual.
 But if I ever want to be able to go look around topside, I'd rather not
 be one of those obnoxious Americans trying to make myself understood across
 a language barrier by speaking loudly and slowly.

\end_inset

Who's teaching you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Seth.
 He's pretty good with it -- he goes up top sometimes, although he has to
 go with somebody to be sure he doesn't run off into the sunset with an
 imprint instead of bringing her home.
 He needs to bring a partner when he guards the tunnels too.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Do humans get in often?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know exactly how often, but there's an entrance that goes up to
 the back room of a pawnshop, and Seth told me that last month a couple
 of teenagers got past the proprietor -- he's human, but he knows some things
 -- and went down.
 Seth and Albert, who was with him, caught them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What...
 happened to them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, softly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, they got caught right at the ladder that leads down from the pawnshop,
 so Seth and Albert were all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hey, you can't be down here, this is private property
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the humans didn't see anything, they just went right back up and the
 pawnshop guy chased them out with an old candlestick.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Oh
\emph default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, relieved.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was worried they'd have been eaten, or something.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not if they don't see something they shouldn't,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Cody.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But if they 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 see something they shouldn't -- or if they won't leave when they're told
 to -- or if they pull a gun on the guard, Seth said that happened a couple
 of years ago -- then, yeah, that's the only way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cody sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, the vampires do have to eat.
 People who know too much are the obvious menu item, right? I guess they
 could just kill them without eating them, but that would be a waste --
 and the Volturi aren't going to run a private, secret prison at their own
 expense just because some people sneak into the back room of a shop and
 ignore all the bright red signs saying to keep out and then won't even
 leave when they're told.
 Right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 I don't eat humans myself and don't plan to start, but if one is 
\emph on
going
\emph default
 to eat humans, one has to pick them out somehow.
 My mother used to justify my father's history of human-eating by pointing
 out that he could read their minds and choose evil ones.
 Trespassers aren't quite in that category, maybe, but compared to random
 people off the street it's probably better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peter and Charlotte probably ate random people off the street, and same
 with the Irish coven, and Huilen and Nahuel and probably Nahuel's sisters.
 And all told, when I think about it, I don't think I've 
\emph on
ever
\emph default
 been informed that whether somebody has eaten or currently eats humans
 is a great way to figure out if they're nice or not.
 Vampires are just people-eating creatures, and even most 
\emph on
vegetarian
\emph default
 ones at least 
\emph on
used
\emph default
 to eat people.
 My mother was all set to eat Pera, even though she'd never eaten anybody
 before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poor Pera was scared out of her wits.
 I decided to apologize to her after I saw her next, since it was partly
 my fault she'd been attacked like that.
 Pera's one of us.

\begin_layout Standard
I was back in my room by the time Jacob woke up, with a book I borrowed
 from the library in North.
 The library is really there for the puppies' lessons -- Brooke told me,
 during the tour -- and so it mostly has kids' stuff, but there were some
 things I never read before, and anyone in the village can borrow a book
 from it if they want.
 If I want more interesting books I'll need to buy them.
 Vivian, from Rachel's pack, handles payroll and allowances for the whole
 village (Brooke told me that too, I'm so glad for Brooke, without her having
 told me everything I'd be so lost), so I decided to go to her and ask for
 my allowance, after talking to Jacob about what to put in the suite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jacob was hungry when he got up, so we went to breakfast, and I had the
 tiniest possible helping of scrambled eggs to try to get used to eating
 on everyone else's schedule, even though I was mostly full from eating
 in the early morning.
 We were there before most of the crowd.
 Brooke came over and sat with us, and said she was going to volunteer to
 move to Jacob's pack, to be in the same pack as her brother Quil.
 She said that almost all siblings are in the same packs as each other,
 but one exception is Darren, Grace, and Ian.
 Darren's still in Jacob's pack and Grace might volunteer to move, but Ian's
 a boy so he can't offer to move with her.
 But they might give him special permission to transfer, she said.
 Brady's brother might do the same thing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quinn came over and sat with us too, and I found out that she's Sam's cousin.
 I asked her if she would change packs too and she said she might, and then
 we speculated for the rest of the meal about who from Rachel's pack besides
 Grace would be moving.
 Brooke thought it might be Ashleigh, since she had only just joined her
 pack and might not be attached to them yet, but Quinn thought it would
 be Vivian, since she's Jared's sister.
 Jacob said he didn't think Vivian would move, because she's a beta, but
 he might try to trade Jared for Ian if Grace moved into his pack, so all
 the siblings could be together.
 We all thought that was a good idea.
 It was like a soap opera, with so many 
\emph on
names
\emph default
, but at least I could remember them all.
 Jacob kept calling Quinn 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Gwyn
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, by mistake, just because their names rhyme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt pleasantly lightheaded all through breakfast, and I wasn't sure why.
 I couldn't remember feeling 
\emph on

 like that ever before, except maybe when I was very small and lived in
 Denali.
 I walked with Jacob back to our rooms, and there were people everywhere,
 coming to have a later breakfast or leaving the cafeteria ahead of us.
 I didn't recognize everyone yet, but they all smiled at me when we passed,
 and I knew I'd learn who everyone was soon enough.

As soon as I thought of this, I felt something a little strange in the back

 It was like my

 I decided that this was probably because I'd left things out when I told
 Jacob about how my legs had gotten hurt.
 Since I was walking just fine, I went ahead and filled him in when we got
 to our suite.

If I hadn't been involving myself because of that stupid plan Jasper thought

I had a lovely day.
 I spent the morning showing memories to Jacob and then joined him for lunch.
 We sat with Cody and Seth and Leah, and Seth was sweet and Leah nearly
 as funny as Cody.
 I went next door to meet my neighbors.
 Albert's imprint was home with their baby Eve.
 The imprint's name is Amanda; she's Canadian, and was in Italy as a tourist
 when Albert saw her.
 She wears her hair in miniature dreadlocks and works in the cafeteria during
 the dinner shift and has a bookshelf full of mystery novels.
 She loaned me a stack of those, and her laptop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went and got my allowance and picked up Jacob's for him, too, and we spent
 the afternoon shopping on the borrowed computer.
 He wanted to replace his tacky quilt, and I needed more clothes.
 Even though I could have asked any girl I happened to run into in the hall
 and been invited to borrow something out of her closet, I'm too thin to
 wear anything that will fit a wolf, and the puppies are too small.
 The only imprint close to my size is Thea.
 I tracked her down -- she was in North with Noah, letting her son play
 next to a couple of other puppies -- and asked her if I could borrow something,
 but she told me that she'd ordered clothes online that hadn't arrived in
 the mail yet, and was borrowing what she had on herself.
 I tried Amanda next, and she's shorter and plumper than I am, but she let
 me have her skinny jeans and a couple of t-shirts and a nightgown, which
 I thought would work well enough until a shipment of my own showed up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was halfway through parceling out my allowance on clothes when Jacob wanted
 dinner, and I went with him, and we sat with Brooke and Quil and Claire.
 It was nice that Brooke finally had her brother back, and Claire took to
 her very promptly.
 Claire had been in the puppies' lessons most of the day, and chattered
 happily about how she was good at cursive and it was curly and she wanted
 to make a new sign for her and Quil's room in script.

Some people are more than friends.
 There are wolves with imprints, and the two wolves who are married to each

Assembly was a couple of hours after dinner.
 Iris's daughter Kirsten turned eight, and we all sang for her.

Becky announced that Brooke and Quinn would be leaving her pack to go to
 Jacob's, and Rachel announced that Gwyn and Grace would be doing the same,
 and all three alphas and the four transfers got in wolf form to make that
 happen smoothly.
 And I thought, 
\emph on
If Santiago and the field team hadn't been there to take me here when I
 went to Denali, I wouldn't have gotten to see Jacob finally have girls
 in his pack, and then who would tease him?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did tease him, and he laughed.
 Then Becky announced that Miles's imprint, Esta, was pregnant with their
 fourth puppy, and was due in November.
 That was it for assembly, and I caught Esta's eye on the way out and asked
 (in Italian) what she was going to name the baby.
 She asked if I had any suggestions, and told me that the ones she already
 had were called Prima and Venitia and Luzio, and since those are all Italian
 names, I said I liked Marietta for a girl or Pietro for a boy, and she
 liked my ideas.
 And I thought, 
\emph on
If I weren't here, I wouldn't have gotten to help name Miles and Esta's
 baby!

 Jacob about government regulations around equal-opportunity employment,

Back in South, I gave Amanda her computer back, and spent the evening with
 a mystery novel in one hand and my other hand on Jacob's face, sending
 him more of my life story.
 I wasn't doing any fancy compression or translation, and it was all real
 memories and not composed hypothetical situations, so I could do both at
 once.
 I was four chapters into Amanda's book when I yawned hugely and wanted
 to go to bed.
 I told Jacob that he could watch my dreams, if he wanted --

 He promised, and so I changed into the borrowed nightshirt and then he
 tucked me in and folded up my hand in his.
 He looked so happy, and I was sorry all over again for leaving him alone
 when he needed me.

And I thought,
