\begin_layout Chapter
Sharer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the village, we only hear a little, every now and then, about what's
 going on in the compound.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chelsea doesn't speak to us much when she comes to assembly -- she'll always
 smile, of course, and answer anyone who talks to her first, but we all
 know that if Afton is there she'd rather be talking to him and if he isn't
 she wants to rush home to him as soon as she's done with her work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Afton, on the other hand, is very talkative, but not so much about what's
 happening up the tunnel.
 He tells stories that are centuries old, or made up entirely; or he'll
 make general remarks about how this or that aphorism is true or misleading
 or meaningless.
 Or if Chelsea is around he'll come up with new ways to say how much he
 loves her.
 Everyone loves Chelsea, but he's hers first, and they're really sweet together.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Santiago is too businesslike for much chat.
 The most she ever opens up is when she gives Gwyn dance lessons.
 I asked to join in on those, and Santiago said I should learn from Gwyn
 first until I was closer to her in skill level and then she'd see about
 including me in the class, so I started meeting Gwyn three times a week
 after lunch when she wasn't too busy with work to dance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Felix talks, but only to the wolves and only about fighting and strategy.
 He organizes tournaments and lessons and things like that, and he's gone
 with field teams more than the other three who ever take them out.
 He's very passionate about his work, and very good at it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Corin's just plain cryptic.
 If it's possible to answer a question without actually 
\emph on
answering
\emph default
 it -- by saying something about the Fates or the cycle of history or something
 else grand like that -- then that's what he'll do.
 If it's not, he might not answer at all.
 It's not that he's not nice.
 He'll 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 things for people -- he let puppies climb on his invisible shield, once,
 and it was the cutest thing -- but he's just not a good source of 
\emph on
news
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This meant that when I got to 
\emph on
go
\emph default
 to the compound, I was very excited about being able to bring back news
 to all my friends.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd been in the village for one week when Addy came to ask me up to the
 compound.
 I was in my room, peeling the sticky labels off my new shirts, and she
 knocked on the door.
 Jake answered it, and wrinkled his nose.
 (Wolves who've been here for a long time have gotten used to how vampires
 smell, but Jake got here only a little before I did.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello, Jacob,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is Elspeth home?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure.
 Elsie?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he called.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I poked my head out of my room.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 I'd picked up the nickname from the other villagers, who told me she didn't
 prefer to go by her full name.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was wondering if you could help me with something,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've thought of a useful application for your power.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, holding out a hand so she could borrow it, but she shook her head.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It involves sending to witches,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she explained, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

so I can't do it myself, since that part of what you do requires touch.
 Why don't you come up with me to the compound, and I'll explain on the
 way?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How long will it take?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No more than a couple of hours.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I hugged Jake goodbye and followed her out and down the hall, to the tunnel
 that led to the compound.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't hang onto your power very long when I had it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but it was interesting, very interesting.
 I would have come by to discuss it with you earlier, but I've been busy
 bringing back all of the witches who escaped.
 I'm sure you remember them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are they all back now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 On the one hand, even if I didn't care personally about any of them, it
 was still very creepy.
 On the other hand, I couldn't honestly say that if they were all set free
 they wouldn't try to hurt some of my friends, and revenge doesn't sit right
 either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Most of them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The fellow who teleports is a bit difficult to catch.
 I think you'll like my idea for what you can do to help.
 How much do you know about what Chelsea does?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I almost reached for her, then remembered not to displace whatever power
 she was borrowing and just summarized instead.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She can cut relationships or build them up but to do the second thing she
 needs something to start with.
 Seeds.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The reason the witches had to be kept in the dungeon the way you saw, instead
 of joining the guard, is that there wasn't enough for Chelsea to work with.
 Before I came along, that meant that they didn't help us defend ourselves
 or keep order in the vampire world at all.
 Afterwards, well, you saw.
 But it would be much safer and better for everyone involved if Chelsea
 could work with them.
 And the witches would be happier too, I'm sure you can imagine.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could imagine that.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where do I come in?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure it will work,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she cautioned, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

but I think you might be able to plant enough 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seeds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that Chelsea can do the rest.
 It will only help with some of the witches -- anyone with a mate, for instance,
 we need to handle with more care -- but it may do for some of them, and
 even that would be a huge favor.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She smiled at me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What do you think I should do specifically?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure.
 That's why I'm going to borrow Edward's power and have Chelsea there, and
 let you know how it goes while you experiment,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy replied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's Benjamin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy, pointing at one of the fragmented heaps.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He actually does have a mate, Tia, but the good news is we have her, right
 over there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 More bits and pieces.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's not a witch, but he's more than valuable enough to make it worth keeping
 her, if -- and only if -- they'll work for us.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I felt sad about the two of them, especially once I learned their names,
 and almost said something, but then the feeling disappeared.
 If they weren't in bits, they might be trying to hurt me or my friends.
 Chelsea was standing silently behind me and Addy.
 Maybe it was her, helping me concentrate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy touched a chunk of rubble from another pile.
 If I looked at the smithereens closely, I could see them twitching, and
 occasionally two of them would draw close to each other and they'd knit
 along an edge.
 It was kind of gross, and I closed my eyes; Addy said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go ahead and say hello to Benjamin, then, Elspeth.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I reached out blindly and laid my hand on some unidentifiable surface of
 a piece of Benjamin.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I -- I don't know if I can make it work any old place, I usually touch people's
 faces or sometimes hold hands,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll let you know if he gets your message,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 promised Addy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Hello, Benjamin,
\emph default
 I sent -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He wants to know who you are,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy murmured -- 
\emph on
my name is Elspeth.
 Tia's alive, she's right here and I can see her.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell him you can pass on messages from her, let him draw his own conclusions
 about how -- tell her you can talk to him for her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy instructed.
 I put my other hand on the other pile, still holding my eyes closed.
 
\emph on
Tia, I'm Elspeth and I can pass on messages to Benjamin for you if there's
 something you want to say.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She wants to tell him...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy said something in a language I didn't know, and I passed it on word-for-wo
rd.
 Chelsea made a quiet, intrigued noise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is tricky, I need Marcus,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Chelsea at one point, and she swirled out of the room, black cloak
 swishing behind her.
 She returned a few moments later, leading a brittle-skinned, glassy-eyed
 Marcus by the hand, and he looked at the piles of vampire I was touching
 and sighed and spoke to Chelsea very softly.
 He looked unhappy and didn't seem interested in the proceedings, but I
 was still slightly in awe -- Marcus is one of what amounts to three kings
 of the entire nonhuman world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chelsea piped up, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Offer him revenge on Amun? We have reason enough to destroy him anyway,
 for hiding Benjamin's gift...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Should I say all of that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, just the first part, and to Tia too,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 clarified Addy.
 
\emph on
The Volturi are willing to offer you revenge on Amun,
\emph default
 I told them, although I wasn't sure I liked that part...
 Addy said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elspeth, Amun deliberately hid Benjamin from the Volturi for many decades
 and spent that time trying to mold him into a weapon.
 I'll give you three guesses why.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He planned to use Benjamin to attack us...? 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottlenecked conversation proceeded steadily, if slowly and awkwardly.
 Chelsea and Marcus talked to each other quietly -- or maybe he talked to
 her and she talked to herself -- and Addy told me what to say, sometimes
 in languages I knew and sometimes not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My magic itched again, so I clarified quickly to Benjamin and Tia exactly
 how I was managing to relay their messages.
 Addy frowned without commenting on my unauthorized disclosure.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why don't you show him the wolf village, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she suggested.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell him that's the most significant thing I've used his power for since
 the seventeenth century, none of the mayhem and destruction he's worried
 about.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I gave Benjamin a virtual tour of the village.
 
\emph on
I live here, it's nice,
\emph default
 I editorialized, swooping through a compressed view of the tour Brooke
 gave me when I first moved in.
 
\emph on
Addy borrowed your power to dig it out, and says it's the biggest thing
 she's done with it since the seventeenth century.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What happened in the seventeenth century?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked aloud.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I visited Egypt, met Benjamin and his coven, borrowed his power, and there
 were assorted adventures that involved toying with the Nile and attempting
 to fly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll show you later, if this works.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That sounded exciting; I'd never been on the receiving end of one of my
 shared memories, but Addy could do exactly what she said.
 I kept passing messages.
 Finally, Chelsea said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Ha,
\emph default
 I've got it -- just barely enough -- Marcus, help me see what I'm doing
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and she closed her eyes, and her fingers twitched at her sides.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy smiled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can stop now, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she murmured.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll take you back to the village.
 We'll try with someone else after seeing how this sticks.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I bowed quickly to Marcus -- Quinn had told me that this was the polite
 thing to do if one saw one of the three Volturi or their wives, and I hadn't
 done so earlier only because I had my hands occupied.
 Then I followed Addy out of the room.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can I please see Pera and Brady before we go?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mm, I'm not sure if you want to see Pera,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's turning at the moment.
 Brady can't bear to leave her, but he's not having a pleasant time of it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I blinked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why isn't Alec helping her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not customary,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Caius believes that the full experience is part of what makes vampires'
 witchcraft tend to improve after turning.
 Exceptions might be made for non-witches -- though we don't often turn
 those ourselves; they come to the Volturi in different ways -- but not
 for someone with a gift as valuable as Pera's.
 She'll be fine, though, don't worry.
 We've all been through it and come out all right.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why does Caius think that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jane is the best evidence by far,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Addy replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you know what she does?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I nodded.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What might surprise you is that her power is very much like your own.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This confused me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But she has range, and only projects pain...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Her power became much more formidable when she left her humanity behind
 her.
 But Jane's witchcraft has been exactly the same in what it does for her
 entire life,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy with a thin smile.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It did not change its nature when she became a vampire.
 What she does is project pain that 
\emph on
she
\emph default
 has experienced, just as you most readily project memories of your own
 life.
 Before she turned, this was limited to scraped knees and stubbed toes and
 the like.
 Since then, she's become one of the most powerful weapons the Volturi have,
 and the most widely feared.
 If I were human yet, and copied her power, I wouldn't be her equal, but
 because I turned normally too, I can wield it just as she does.
 It is unlikely, but not outside the realm of possibility, that Pera will
 find herself improved in some way for an unaided turning.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've been able to get better at what I do, and I've always been the same
 species,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, we don't have quite so much to go on regarding hybrids like yourself.
 I do think you are intriguing, though,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd like to get to know you and your power better.
 I have something of an interest in witches, as you might imagine.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addy smiled at me, and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you'd really like to have a peek at Pera and Brady...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're probably right about it being a bad idea, but I really miss them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said sheepishly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And Pera might not come back to the village right away -- there are imprints
 and puppies who smell like food.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's true,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 acknowledged Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Up this way.
 I'll even let you try to take Pera's mind off what's happening for a few
 minutes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she offered, and I grinned at her while she led me up two flights of stairs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The screaming was audible from a fair distance, and fluctuated as we approached
 between piercing wails and lower sobbing moans.
 I winced in sympathy, but Addy had said I might be able to help, and so
 I pressed on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pera was lying face-up on the floor of a fairly ordinary room, halfway between
 her human brown color and the olive cast to some vampires' skin.
 With another scream, she arched her back, knees and elbows pushing her
 off the floor while she leaned her head back and stretched her mouth open
 as far as it would go.
 Brady knelt beside her, nearly as much agony on his face as hers, though
 he didn't scream.
 He was holding her hand, and tears were continually renewing twin lines
 down his face while he whispered fractions of sentences to her.
 He looked like he hadn't slept in a couple of days and didn't plan to sleep
 for a couple more, and he didn't even glance in my and Addy's direction
 when we walked in.
 He was transfixed by Pera and she barely seemed to realize he was there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I approached her quietly.

 I murmured to Brady, and he spared me a split second of eye contact before
 returning his stare to his imprint.
 I knelt and reached for Pera's face, which was already chillier than it
 would have been while she was human, and tried to decide what to send.

Eventually I settled on the same memory of sitting on the beach and watching
 the sunset that I'd shown back when Thea induced me to learn to add translation
s to sendings.
 I didn't translate for Pera, I just focused on the peace of the evening
 and the beauty of the sunset.
 Something in her breathing changed, but she didn't talk or otherwise acknowledg
e me; I glanced at Addy for feedback.

Try something that's not a memory,

 said Addy.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

One of your hypothetical situations, as devoid of content as you can make
 it.
 It's very hard to concentrate on positive things while in that much pain,

 empty.

I thought of the blank place with no color that I talked to myself in, subtracte

 She relaxed, letting her spine conform to the floor again, and Brady made
 a small noise as there was a pause in her screaming.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Addy said.

Very nice.
 You may go on for...

I believe we can get away with that long of a respite.

 Brady whined in the back of his throat, but asked no further questions.
 I sent Pera the blank place until Addy said,

Time is up.
 Come along, Elspeth.

I pulled back, and a groan forced its way out of Pera's throat and through

Could we

 Caius -
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said, flexing my hands to stop myself from reaching out and offering
 Pera comfort without permission.
 She was one of us, but Caius was one of the three

Addy looked at me speculatively.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I will be interested to see if you can convince him,

 she said.

Why don't we see how that goes?

 She crooked a finger at me, and I scrambled to my feet to follow her out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caius was in a round hall I hadn't seen before, although from the slitted
 windows and the wooden thrones, I thought it was probably the room my mother
 had mentioned meeting the Volturi in.
 I didn't know how to match names to all the faces, but Caius was recognizeable
 by description.
 I bowed to him, and Addy made a little curtsey of acknowledgement, as we
 entered the room.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Caius bluntly from his seat.
 He was in second chair from the left, which was a short distance from the
 only other occupied seat on the far left.
 That one held an onionskinned vampire woman with a dark cascade of curls
 and a haughty expression, who, at a guess, I thought might be Caius's mate
 Athenodora.
 Addy caught my eye and nodded.
 
\emph on
Should I say it?

 I thought, recalling that she still had my father's power.
 She nodded again.

I wanted to ask permission to send her something soothing, to make it easier

 She smiled enigmatically at him.
 I ducked my head, not daring to push further.

Oh, well,

The next day, Addy visited the village again, just after I left Jared and
 Kim's.
 I'd been there to get Kim to cut my hair.
 It had come time to trim the ends, and in the absence of a compelling reason
 to do 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 that, I had her lopping off the mass of waves at a point in the middle
 of my back.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If I decide I don't like having it shorter, it'll grow back down to my ankles
 in about six months,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I reassured her when she was reluctant to help with such a dramatic change.
 So she tied my hair up at the ends, scissored her way across the designated
 point, and handed me a detached bronze ponytail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thanked her and gave her a few euros -- she was making her living as the
 village's barber, largely taking the place of Geoffrey's buzz-cutting service
 and Shawn's overenthusiastic stylings.
 Then I opened the door, only to find Addy standing there, poised to knock.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oh, hello,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said, smiling at me.

 I said.

Just let me toss this...
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I held up one finger, and Addy waited for me in the corridor until I'd
 been and gone to the lounge trash can to discard the hair.

Do you want me to talk to another witch?

 I asked.

Not yet.
 We're still waiting for Benjamin and Tia to heal, and we'll see how they

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No, I only wanted to talk to you -- or perhaps not talk.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 She winked at me and held out her hand.

I clasped hands with her, and Addy shut her eyes for a moment.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So interesting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she murmured.

Do you know, Elspeth, that your power is expanded in more

The

detail
\emph default
 in the memory was too much to take.
 My real vision whited out, the quiet village sounds faded into static,
 I lost the pressure of stone on the soles of my feet, while my brain tried
 to process the crisp, high-fidelity overload of vampire senses.
 I might have made some noise; I couldn't tell.
 The colors alone threw me into confusion -- what 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 that extra one? Was that ultraviolet? I always imagined some sort of whitish-pu
rple when I tried to guess what it would look like, but it wasn't anything
 like that.
 There were sounds higher and fainter than my real ears could ever take
 in.
 Richer smells pouring thickly into my imaginary nose, piled on top of each
 other without losing nuance.
 Prickles of feeling along felt-as-though-remembered skin, describing shapes
 and textures underfoot and all the way up with precision that thundered
 into my mind too quickly to process as

There was pain, too, a demanding dry burn scrubbing my throat raw, and the

And then on top of all that, beyond impressions that mapped onto senses

Something like taste, but not quite.
 More like the sensation of drawing food into my mouth, obeying but not

Abruptly, the intrusive excess disappeared.

I don't know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I panted, knitting my eyebrows at the strange sense of loss.
 The air held smells, but they were no longer key tools; they were just
 footnotes to the primary senses.
 Which were in turn also diminished, flattened by comparison -- there was
 a 
\emph on
missing color

\emph on

 it; there was an entire register of informative little noises, up high,
