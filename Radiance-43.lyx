Once Pera had unhidden the smaller group, Allirea spoke first: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How long do I need to be unfaded?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Until I'm safely out of the way or hidden again,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We don't know yet whether Bella's shield will prevent your power from `infecting
' me and shouldn't count on her shielding abilities anyway, especially since
 I'm not Elspeth or Edward.
 Elspeth, did you deprogram Pera yet?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I probably should have done it on the plane, but she seemed occupied.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fair enough.
 Pera, please hide Elspeth again for a moment to let her do her job,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As long as you won't occupy the same space as Bella.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The configuration of people around me shifted again, and I looked at Pera,
 tilted my head, and ran through the now-familiar push of de-Chelseaing.
 Pera twitched, and Razi, who still had his arms around her, held her a
 little tighter, but she didn't say anything, and then reached out and unhid
 me again.
 I began to suspect that it would become very tedious to swap between the
 hiding place and outside whenever I needed to interact with a different
 set of people just because Pera didn't want to share a dimension with my
 mother.
 Siobhan asked when I reappeared, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All done?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\emph on
Oh, and...

\emph default
 I sent Siobhan my mother's concerns about incentives to do my father harm.
 
\emph on
I forgot to tell you that before because I forgot my mother existed when
 Allirea was fading her, and when Allirea was asleep I guess I was too.

\emph default
 It occurred to me that I'd also agreed to relay some information from my
 mother to Pera, namely that the former had tried to stop herself from killing
 the latter, but I was otherwise engaged at the moment, so I made a mental
 note to do it later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Siobhan didn't react visibly beyond glancing at my mother.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'll also,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said to me, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

need to show the Volturi to everyone who hasn't seen them already and doesn't
 already have a mate.
 May as well start with Nathan, since he's already outside with us.

 Nathan laughed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There might be a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 So I showed him Heidi and Renata and Santiago and Emel and Emere (skipping
 Li-qing because of her own preferences), and then, supposing it was better
 to be safe than sorry, included Jane despite her young physical age.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

First lady on that list there is 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 attractive, but no, none of them are making my unbeating heart swoon and

 he reported.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Sorry.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, same deal with the rest of our friends, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Pera, once more, please...
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
I was hidden again, and went through all eighteen single vampires, from
 Tanya to the Romanians, sending images of candidate Volturi.
 No one reacted to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slideshow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as though they'd just seen their mate, and Pera unhid me so I could relay
 this to Siobhan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Drat,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan, succinctly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But at least we won't be caught off guard by someone who's supposed to be
 working for us spontaneously falling in love with the enemy.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you show David to anyone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It wouldn't exactly be a disaster if we had his mate here with us and found
 this out during the coup, since he's not a Volturi, but it'd still probably
 be better to know sooner rather than later.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I didn't, no,

\begin_layout Standard
I was hidden again, and offered everyone who was single and attracted to
 men a memory of David, but again there were no takers.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've seen David before, Elspeth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tanya pointed out when I carelessly included her.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's lived with us for about six years.
 I would have noticed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pera, if you'll unhide me again please...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She tapped me on the shoulder and I was back outside with my mother, Jake,
 Siobhan and Liam, and Nathan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No mate for David,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Should we consider the possibility that Addy's going to wind up with somebody
 by the end of all this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

or do we have reason to exclude the possibility?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy's borrowed Alice's power,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The first vision Alice ever had after she turned was of Jasper.
 I think if Addy had a potential mate walking around today, she'd have seen
 him in a vision when she first touched Alice.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think we can count on that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For instance, that would fail trivially if Addy's mate were -- as an example
 -- Nahuel.
 She wouldn't be able to get a vision of him, and yet we know the species
 combination to be possible.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Allirea hissed quietly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And we don't know whether Addy would necessarily have gotten such a vision
 even in the case of another vampire being the mate in question; Alice is
 a sample size of one.
 However,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan continued, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think it would be a good idea to 
\emph on
actually
\emph default
 wind up with Addy mated to anyone we're hoping to make use of.
 She has my power; that's just handing her a tool she can probably use as
 well as we can, and we still don't know what she wants.
 So what I'd 
\emph on
like
\emph default
 is to borrow Alice
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Alice appeared, mildly confused -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and have her and Elspeth try to figure out whether any of our friends would
 be interested in Addy 
\emph on
without actually so interesting them.

\emph default
 But, Pera, we can't actually do that, because Alice cannot see things that
 Elspeth is involved in, so while your proactive unhiding of people whose
 names I mention offhand is appreciated in concept, it is not called for
 in practice.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 do that one myself if I could see Addy, but she's still blanked out...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 groused Alice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And I'd say go for it, if you could, but you can't,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said, tapping her foot.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't think we have any angle to figure out Addy-related mating avenues
 without actually showing her to everyone.
 The question is whether it's safer to do so or not.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What would you do if we did have Addy's mate in our merry band,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother commented, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

keep him safe at home so he doesn't foul things up? We don't know where
 Addy is, so he couldn't really gallivant off to find her, on any reasonable
 time scale...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's roughly what I'd do, with the possible exception of Nathan,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nathan being our only unmated witch and one of the most important individuals
 to our current plan of attack, unless you count Allirea and Elspeth.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Should
\emph default
 we count Allirea and Elspeth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 my mother asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As unmated witches, I mean, not as important to the plan.
 I suppose they've both seen everybody already, but we don't know exactly
 how half-vampires work.
 They might or might not be a `first sight' situation, for one thing.
 We only have guesses based on Allirea's case...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And on Elspeth's case,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan pointed out.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chelsea never detected anything out of the ordinary in Elspeth's feelings
 towards Jacob.
 It's a standard one-way imprint.
 So we know half-vampires don't mirror wolves -- for that matter, we also
 know full vampires don't mirror wolves, or Brady would still be alive --
 and we know half-vampires don't mirror vampires.
 If they do something, it's not something we can use, because whoever our
 resident hybrids would be attached to wouldn't be attached back to them
 in turn.
 In any event...
 I think we've got to risk letting at least Nathan have a look at Addy,
 Elspeth.
 Better to know now and re-work the plan with Alistair or Bella in that
 role after all than to get a nasty surprise later.
 Hop to.
 I'd like to get this phase of the prep work out of the way.
 I'm not being theatrical about it, but the idea of weaponizing mating 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 make me 
\emph on
rather uncomfortable.
\emph default

\end_inset

 Liam touched her shoulder and she lifted her hand to clasp his fingers
 there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alice, who hadn't been rehidden yet, looked a little queasy at having it
 put that way herself.
 Then she disappeared back into the hiding place.
 My mother seemed comparatively unconcerned when I looked her way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go on then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 prompted Nathan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

let's see if I'm destined to be with...
 Actually, shouldn't finish that sentence, as if I 
\emph on
am
\emph default
 I imagine I shall regret it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I showed him Addy, and he tilted his head, then shook it.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The t-shirt from the Italian equivalent of the National Blood Service is

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's check everybody else, too,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said, and I was pulled into the hiding place and blanketed everyone
 there with the same image, to no enthusiastic reply, and Pera unhid me
 again.
 I shook my head in response to Siobhan's questioning look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Siobhan.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We won't find ourselves unexpectedly serving as matchmakers for Addy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What's next?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Next,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Siobhan said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

unless I am very uncharacteristically mistaken, we go to Volterra.

\begin_layout Standard
Pera hid everyone except my mother and Allirea again, and we went back to
 the airport and piled onto another airplane, this time headed for Italy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I ran through the plan in my head, over and over: when Alice said everybody
 was going to be in the compound (and, consequently, not in or within hearing
 distance of the village), Nathan and I would break a skylight to get into
 the wolf village.
 He would...
 somehow...
 (I had to trust Siobhan about this part)...
 be able to singlehandedly make sure that in addition to being unable to
 attack me, the wolves would also not trap me or get word to the compound.
 We'd both go in with our phones open and connected so Siobhan could hear
 what was going on.
 After I deprogrammed everybody in the village, Nathan would go on ahead
 and...
 somehow...
 (Siobhan knew what she was doing, right?)...
 break practically everybody in the Volturi guard, probably excepting only
 Renata, her immediately protected charges, and Heidi.
 When it got to that point...
 well, Siobhan hadn't told me yet if I was supposed to go in, blast Renata,
 and stand guard over my father.
 I sent her the question, in yes-or-no-format pieces, so she could nod and
 shake her head without divulging the details to anyone else on the plane,
 and she confirmed that I should do that -- after she sent me a message
 telling me to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometime after all of that, we would decide who lived, who died, who ruled
 the world.

 They

 And that wasn't much of a choice when it was a choice between my pack or
 being a kept wolf in Volterra.
 I swore I'd never do it, early on, but I'm...
 I wasn't a good enough leader to hold everybody together without it.
 I managed, with, and I don't think anyone resented me that badly for it,

 -- I didn't want to be spotted through someone's ceiling before I was ready
 to be noticed -- I questioned Siobhan's decision to send me into the village
 completely by myself.
 I distinctly remembered a lot of discussion going on about how if I went
 alone, I'd be safe from direct wolf attack, but 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 immobilization and summoned vampires.
 Yet there I was, preparing to smash in a skylight and drop myself into
 my former home without any backup.
 I decided that I'd best deprogram everybody very 
\emph on
briskly
\emph default
 to compensate for this.
 I'd tried doing it from the field, but had no way of knowing whether it
 worked until I actually went down there.
 I didn't have data indicating one way or the other that eye contact or
 closer proximity was necessary.
 The experiment with Eleazar only told me that I didn't need to physically
 touch my targets.

\begin_layout Standard
I found the skylight that would drop me into the central playroom in North,
 where I could expect to land in a cluster of puppies and imprints and where
 the initial noise caused by my home invasion could be attributed to a pup
 knocking over something fragile.
 That, I thought, should prevent anyone from a neighboring room from being
 too alarmed too soon.
 I flattened myself against the grass and looked at the mirror.
 I didn't want to just smash it open -- that would have broken glass raining
 onto anyone standing under the window and could hurt someone.
 Addy had created the village's physical infrastructure, though, with Benjamin's
 power to move the earth and stone and Emel's to work metal pieces.
 I knew how the skylight was installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dug my fingers into the soil at the edge of the mirror and pried it up
 as carefully as I could, and then, not giving anyone a chance to react
 to the noise, swung my legs down into the angled hole and slid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I landed half on top of the Stross twins and my knee clipped a rather pregnant
 Esta in the arm; the boys screeched and Esta yelped, but they didn't seem
 to be injured.
 I scrambled off of them, pushed myself to my feet and spun around to take
 note of who was in the room, and hit all thirty-five occupants with a single
 concentrated strike of deprogramming.

The other adults in the room were Amanda, my former neighbor, her wolf Albert,
 and Kim without her Jared.
 Albert handed his daughter abruptly to his imprint and phased in an explosion
 of coal-gray fur, snarling low in his throat, but he didn't make a move
 against me.
 I knew he could be getting in telepathic contact with someone, but it wasn't
 likely; wolves weren't usually in that form during the day...

 I said, and I danced through knee-deep confused puppies of assorted ages
 to peep into the girl orphans' dorm, then the boys', where I was able to
 catch another two and five little ones respectively in the deprogramming
 wave.
 I ducked back into the playroom, hearing no breathing or heartbeats from
 anywhere else in North, and found my way briefly blocked by Albert, but
 I ducked past him, finding him unaccountably slow to respond when I wove
 around and out the door.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Albert was in Rachel's pack; if he'd talked to anyone it was one of hers
 -- so I went next to East, wrenching open door after door to find familiar
 face after familiar face, furred or otherwise.
 Ashleigh, dark silver and not grown yet but willing and able to yip at
 me...
 Gregory, too stunned to phase, standing there while I waved my hand in
 an unnecessary gesture to accompany my work...
 Joel and Ian, knocking over their Parcheesi board to turn into black and
 blonde quadrupeds and bark...
 Marilyn, chasing me down the hall slower than she could run, fearful of
 doing me harm...

Cody and Seth, in their room, watching an old Batman movie which played
 on in the background even after I yanked their door open, and Cody 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 hurt me, he wasn't a fettered wolf or a harmless human, but I could blast
 him if he tried.
 But he didn't, he just stared, and I met his eyes for a moment and then
 moved to the next door, and the next, the word 
\emph on
truth
\emph default
 gradually turning meaningless as I repeated it over and over in my head.
 Karen, Embry, Laurel, Ken, Leah, Calvin, Vivian, Zachary...
 the others would be in South if they were home, and I didn't know whether
 to think all of Jake's old pack had gone back whence they came...
 where was Rachel?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hurtled into the outer hallway that encircled the village, made a right
 turn, took a moment to marvel at the fact that no one was chasing me, and
 burst through the entrance into the South common room.
 The door to the laundry was propped open and Danielle was there with a
 basket of towels on her hip, the entire Jarvis family was mingling with
 Sam and Emily and Paige, Miles was teaching his eldest Prima how to find
 the drawing program she liked on the communal computer.
 I stayed put just long enough to take attendance and push 
\emph on

\emph default
 at everyone there, then flung myself through the opposite door into the
 dorm hallway.

\begin_layout Standard
I blew through South, ignoring the impulse to pause at 
\emph on
my
\emph default
 old room -- my and 
\emph on
Jake's
\emph default
 old room -- for longer than the split second it took to confirm its emptiness.
 Our names were still on the door...
 I made eye contact with every wolf, imprint, and puppy in the section,
 deprogramming in ones and twos and threes and ignoring the confused yells
 of my name, and then raced up the corridor to West.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was Rachel, sitting with her sister in the West common area.
 They phased in the same moment when they saw me, black fur and white, but
 neither moved.
 I flung the newly well-practiced deprogramming at them, made a mental note
 to double back and talk to them when I'd gotten everyone, and moved on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I found most of the wolves I hadn't seen yet in the dorms of West, and raced
 into the cafeteria to check there for the handful I'd missed.
 They were all there, getting snacks, and I flailed my arm in their direction
 as though physically flinging enforced honesty in their faces.
 I wished briefly that I could have just dropped into the cafeteria during
 a mealtime when everyone was eating and done it all at once, but Alice
 had noticed a vampire missing from the compound during or shortly after
 each such time, and having to run around a bit was worth the leeway on
 lag time between deprogramming the village and assaulting the compound.

Rachel contracted into her human shape and picked up the white uniform that

 said Rachel.

That makes sense.
 But I mean after you do that, assuming you can -- who knows, maybe you
 can -- what becomes of us? This isn't just a matter of making sure we don't
 consider the Volturi our close personal friends.
 They also, you know, employ us, and own the village we live in, and preserve
 enough secrecy that we don't get shot at by spooked random humans, and
 arrange things so it's feasible for us to go about our lives while legally
 dead.
