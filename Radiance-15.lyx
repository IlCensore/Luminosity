A minor magical mishap?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repeated Jacob when Addy had gone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She borrowed my power,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and showed me one of her memories, but it was -- too much, and I don't know
 if it was because she's a vampire with really powerful senses, or what.
 That didn't happen to any imprints 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 showed stuff to, and they're human, and Addy's right that it should be
 about the same either way...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can you show me what she showed you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he suggested.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe we can figure it out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's really intense and I think I want to eat Kim now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You know you're not going to eat Kim,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jake.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here, I'll sit down first.
 Go ahead.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My hand trembled, but I held it to his face, and offered up the second-long
 experience.
 His eyes unfocused and he held his breath, but he didn't topple off his
 chair, and when the memory was over, he said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That was sure something.
 Definitely a hop, skip and a jump up from your stuff.
 I wonder if it's just because of the extra sense, that...
 taste that wasn't a taste? The rest of it was seriously dense, but I don't
 think it could have knocked you over.
 You don't seem to have anything like that.
 Unless you're leaving stuff out, your power doesn't feel like anything
 to you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sometimes it does,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just not often.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Really? Can I see?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I sent him the little itch in my magic that had begun to trouble me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Gah!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He made a bewildered face.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay, that's weird.
 It's like a really 
\emph on
insistent
\emph default
 hunch that something's wrong, except it's not a hunch...
 or anything else but itself.
 When does that happen?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't quite have a pattern for it yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It never happened before I moved in here.
 Usually I can make it go away if I tell someone something that I've been
 leaving out -- the first time it happened, I went to let you know how my
 legs got broken.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Huh.
 Well, on top of all the rest of that memory, I think the sense you don't
 have might have done it.
 Maybe the next time Addy wants to experiment, you can get her to show you
 some non-witch vampire's memory? I'm sure she's touched Aro before, and
 that would give her lots to choose from.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sounds like a good test,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I agreed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Addy's probably used to acquiring new senses and handling them all the time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake speculated.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Since that's what she does naturally.
 Maybe she figures out what she's got and how to use it by the non-taste
 taste.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe.
 I'll ask her next time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 Jake smiled and petted my newly shortened hair -- which was starting to
 float up into a voluminous puff, relieved of half the weight that had pulled
 it down.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She's probably better equipped than anybody to help me figure my magic out.
 And that itch especially.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next morning, before Jake got up, I tried to distract myself from hunger
 long enough to have breakfast with everyone else.
 I attempted to invent a new form of solitaire with the deck of cards Quinn
 left behind after we hosted the pack poker game.
 I read a chapter of a novel.
 I visited Karen, who had the night shift in North and was there to look
 after wakeful puppies if they got up and wanted glasses of water or hugs.
 She whispered and I sent, to avoid disturbing them, but conversation soon
 fizzled out, and I hugged her goodbye and wandered away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went back to my room, and leaned my face on my hand, and talked to myself
 again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one of me signed at the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the other replied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What part of me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm my magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I jerked my head up, startled, and the blank place disappeared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could talk to my own magic? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought about this, and then decided it was awesome and pressed my palm
 to my cheek again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why do you itch?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked my magic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't want to lie,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Magic replied.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I won't help you do it.
 When you try I'll try to stop you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You never itched before, though.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You never lied to 
\emph on
yourself
\emph default
 before,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Magic said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and that's worse.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What am I lying to myself about?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the me-who-wasn't-magic.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Me
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for short, I decided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're making excuses for our new friends.
 You're refusing excuses to our old friends.
 You're justifying how Chelsea makes us feel even though you know she did
 it and could have done it to make you like almost anyone.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't understand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Me said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course I know what Chelsea does.
 But everything I've said about all our friends -- past and present -- 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 true.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're 
\emph on
leaving things out,
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Magic said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For example: 
\emph on
Yes.

\emph default
 David was trying to hurt Daphne.
 
\emph on
Yes.

\emph default
 Daphne is thirteen.
 
\emph on
But.

\emph default
 She is still a wolf, still dangerous, and she was attacking David, and
 he didn't 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 how old she is.
 We know that.
 If we didn't care about David 
\emph on
or
\emph default
 Daphne, that would still matter -- perhaps we'd blame both of them or neither
 -- but Chelsea tipped the scales, opposite from how they were before.
 So now you care about making Daphne look innocent because she's our friend,
 and don't mind if you have to do that by rationalizing at David's expense,
 because he isn't our friend anymore.
 But it's not that simple.
 And you 
\emph on
know that
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dropped my hand away from my face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt very complicated all of a sudden.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake woke up shortly after that, and I distracted myself all day.
 I ate an enormous breakfast, loading and re-loading my plate until Jake
 started joking that I'd turned into a wolf overnight.
 I went to North and played with the puppies.
 I practiced dancing.
 I finished my book and started another one.
 I got into an hour-long argument with Grace and Quil about whether it was
 technically piracy for me to show people movies I'd seen, as long as I'd
 paid to see them in the first place.
 Brooke asked me for Portuguese lessons and gave up after ten minutes.
 I learned that Miles played piano and had one in his family's suite, and
 he taught me 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chopsticks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and a couple of scales.
 I did everything but think about how I was 
\emph on
leaving things out
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was very, very afraid of what would happen if I put them back 
\emph on
in
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's 
\emph on
nice
\emph default
 in the village.
 That's the thing.
 It really is comfortable and fun and pleasant.
 Chelsea alone wouldn't hold all of the villagers in some awful pit; at
 best she could make them leave in 
\emph on
groups
\emph default
.
 The compound's different -- set up for sleepless vampires, not wolves and
 select humans and the odd hybrid -- but nice in its way for them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chelsea 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 hold a lot of us in a nice place like the village, because there will always
 be at least one person who wants the easy, happy life for 
\emph on
itself
\emph default
, and Chelsea can make sure that no one can bear to leave that person behind
 or hurt them by tearing them away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was pretty sure that I was that person.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't have to run from place to place without a permanent home.
 I didn't have to tell anyone my name was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Beth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I didn't have to be restrained in my use of magic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I didn't 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to leave.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could just stay.
 I could stay forever.
 I could learn to dance, and look after puppies, and read a lot of books,
 and let Jake dote on me, and research my power with Addy, and paint a new
 mural in the hall every few months.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I just left a few things out, when I explained this decision to myself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My magic itched.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You had some very weird dreams yesterday evening,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jake told me over breakfast.
 I concealed my surprise by taking a large bite of my waffle.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you okay? I think maybe you should ask Addy to hold off on researching
 your power -- at least beyond her copying it herself and using it as much
 as she can without your help.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What did I dream about that makes you think it was Addy's fault?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did I have weird dreams the first night after she came by, too?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, no,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he admitted.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not the part that I watched, anyway.
 They were just...
 it's not like they had weird 
\emph on
content
\emph default
.
 Same faces as always, villagers and vampires and whatnot.
 But the feelings attached were really unsettled, kind of sad and scared
 -- and you used to have happy dreams.
 Are you not happy anymore?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way he asked the question made it really awkward to answer.
 He felt personally responsible for my happiness; if I told him 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm fine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he'd know I was lying, but if I told him I wasn't fine there would be no
 way to put him off finding out what was the matter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I just told him, what would he do? Jake was the only person I could 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 count on, who would 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 put my interests first.
 So he might be safe to talk to.
 Aro didn't exactly show up at assemblies to check for seditious thoughts.
 And Addy could hear my thoughts from the compound, if she borrowed my father's
 power; it didn't seem that much 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 likely that she'd notice something amiss if I told Jake.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is something,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd rather talk in private, though.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he agreed, placated, and then stole a corner of my waffle.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mm, chocolate chip.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gwyn came and sat with us, and she and I spent the rest of breakfast planning
 to put on a small dance performance together at an assembly in a week's
 time.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Santiago says she'll come watch,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Gwyn said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And she'll decide then if you can start coming to my lessons.
 I think she'll let you.
 You're learning a lot faster than I did when I started.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't have to 
\emph on
feign
\emph default
 excitement about that, exactly, but I did have to fight to make sure that
 was the dominant emotion on my face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake and I went back to our rooms, and he said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So -- what's up?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd rather you didn't tell anybody else,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I began, and he held up a hand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hold it right there.
 By `anybody else' do you mean 
\emph on
anybody
\emph default
 else? The pack...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt like a complete fool.
 Involuntary telepathy in wolf form with the rest of his pack -- why had
 I forgotten? Maybe just because the pack were all my friends, and even
 if I 
\emph on
knew
\emph default
 I could get in some kind of trouble if an extra-loyal wolf knew of my unsettled
 thoughts, I couldn't 
\emph on
feel
\emph default
 it, I couldn't 
\emph on
quite
\emph default
 mistrust my friends.
 Jake might want to keep secrets for me if I needed him to, but he 
\emph on
couldn't
\emph default
, not unless he scheduled his phasing for when Quil, Sam, Brady, Jared,
 Victor, Gwyn, Brooke, Grace, Quinn, and Darren were 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 on two feet.
 Which he wouldn't even be allowed to do, since the alphas had to telepathically
 coordinate field teams from safety at home, and his wolves were already
 in training to go out into the world and need his management.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jake noticed me drooping, of course, and put his hand on my shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
 If you need somebody to tell secrets to, you're not out of luck necessarily
 -- just can't be me, if you don't want them going farther.
 I'd try, but I'm not that great at policing my thoughts.
 You could talk to Kim, or Amanda, or any of the other imprints -- or one
 of the vampires -- I don't know what it is, so I don't know who'd be best,
 but not 
\emph on
everybody
\emph default
 around here is telepathic.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded, but tempting as it was to talk to Kim or Amanda or another imprint,
 there wasn't the 
\emph on
surety
\emph default
 there that they had my best interests at heart.
 Of course they liked me (
\emph on
Chelsea made them,
\emph default
 I thought -- but Kim had liked me at least a little before, and even without
 Chelsea I'd found that people liked me more than they 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

should
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

...).
 But Kim had Jared, and Amanda had Albert 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 baby Eve, and if they thought I was threatening the village somehow, then
 what would they do? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I'm going to turn into such a paranoid,
\emph default
 I sighed inwardly, and Jacob pulled me into a hug.
 I snuggled up.
 I couldn't talk to him about my problem, but that wasn't the only comfort
 in the world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
*** 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I developed a habit of spending the time between dinner and assembly talking
 to myself.
 Jake called it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meditating
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which I don't think is 
\emph on
customarily
\emph default
 done with one's hand on one's face while conversing with one's magic, but
 it was as good a word as any.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magic is more frustrating than I would have expected a splinter of myself
 to be if I'd been asked before I 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

met
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 her.
 As a whole, I'm generally in favor of truth-telling, I prefer it and everything
, but she's 
\emph on
fanatical
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you'd work to make me sound honest even when I'm not, or let incomplete
 true things sound just as good as complete true things, it would really
 help sometimes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I told her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why not?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's not how I work,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Magic said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But you've changed how you work before!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not like that.
 I'm here to be truthful.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I spent two days arguing with her about that.

 She didn't say anything, and I didn't receive stern warnings from any of

Addy was gone from the village for a week before she came to see me again.
 She chose a time when Jake wasn't home -- he was practicing coordinating
 field operations with the pack, and I wasn't supposed to be in the room
 in case I distracted him, so he was in an empty dorm room over in West.
 Addy barged in without even knocking, while I was busy composing word problems
 for the older puppies' math tests as a favor to Paul.
 I'd heard the footsteps but didn't know they were hers until she opened
 the door.

 I said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Um, Jacob thinks that the reason I was so overwhelmed by your memory was
 because you have an extra sense that I don't, and the reason I wouldn't
 have knocked humans over when I sent to them is because my power usually
 doesn't feel like anything.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 She nodded.

She did think her name a few seconds later, but I wasn't sure if you'd care

 If you're so curious, Santiago's real name is Tamara Morales.
 Don't call her that.

I lost track of time completely while Addy showed me memories, three steps

 I remembered being dozens of people, Volturi and just assorted vampires

 I remembered seeing the bottom of the ocean and the tops of the Alps, traveling
 through the desert and the jungle, visiting cities and deserted wildernesses.
 I remembered not just dancing, but painting and sculpting and singing and
 -- once -- fighting a pitched battle, although the pain of that was far
