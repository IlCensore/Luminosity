\begin_layout Chapter
Breaker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My footsteps echoed weakly in the long hallway between the village and the
 compound.
 I could have made the run in under a minute, but I was reluctant to sprint,
 so I went at nearly Olympic slowness instead -- peak human speed, no more.
 When I got to the last hundred feet of tunnel, I slowed further still,
 wondering at the fact that no vampires from the compound had heard me coming
 and moved to intercept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stepped around the last corner, and saw the basement entrance, covered
 in snowdrifts of vampire fragments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't tell who anyone was; although shreds of hair among the rubble
 gave me clues, there was no way to be sure from that alone.
 There were at least two, maybe three people's worth of pieces scattered
 haphazardly around the room.
 I gawked for a moment, then tiptoed through the mess and slipped up the
 stairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were pieces everywhere.
 I saw more on the next floor, and the next, in chunks of increasing size
 as though someone had come via the same route as me and been in more and
 more of a hurry as they went.
 There was someone's hand, minus a pinky but otherwise intact, scrabbling
 around in the debris blindly; I shuddered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wished I could just let out an ambient blast, like Addy had twelve days
 previously, but that ran the risk of hitting anyone on our side who'd gotten
 within range, and Siobhan had told me in no uncertain terms that I was
 to hit only 
\emph on
Renata
\emph default
 (and Chelsea, if I happened to spot her in something other than a thousand
 pieces, but that was not likely since she didn't have any unusual protection
 from physical attack, and a lot of that had obviously been going on recently).
 I'd managed to communicate with Jake prior to my second escape from Volterra
 without laying eyes on him, but that use of my power had proven to have
 better range than the memory blast, as Addy had shown, or Jake would have
 been caught in that too.
 I had to actually 
\emph on
find
\emph default
 Renata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I climbed past the ground floor, I was able to hear the sounds of ongoing
 fighting.
 Awful screeching noises as vampires were torn limb from limb, incoherent
 snarls and screams of fury and a high flutelike shriek that I was sure
 belonged to Jane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went up and up stair after stair, dread mounting somwhere behind my collarbone
, and burst through the open door into the throne room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was still more rubble in the huge circular room, but it was also full
 of whole and whole-enough-to-move vampires.
 I saw about half of the insurgency (no Jake, he was away to make sure that
 my imprint status couldn't be abruptly revoked) -- I couldn't tell at a
 glance how many missing were scattered on the floor and how many had abandoned
 the cause at the last minute.
 In the middle of the room was Renata in the center of a shifting ring of
 crouching, protected Volturi: Jane, her face a mask of fury; Alec, stoic
 yet wide-eyed; Aro with the necklace holding Marcus's eye to the nape of
 his neck; Sulpicia, trembling, not seeming to know what to do with her
 hands; Santiago, poised to dance her way into a fight as soon as someone
 got close enough; Chelsea, looking lost and waifish without her Afton;

My brain overloaded.
 I stared.
 She was just ideally put together, art defying reality with her resplendent
 perfection, ornamenting the world, too enchanting to be real...
 I took a step forward...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I heard my mother's voice shouting my name, and I stopped in my tracks and
 blinked, and there was Heidi, lovely but not overwhelming, in a combative
 crouch hissing at a cluster of rebels who were drifting her way.
 My mother growled wordlessly and the group -- Emmett, Kate and her new
 mate Garrett, and Eleazar -- snapped out of the spell abruptly and scrambled
 back.
 My mother, perched on the back of one of the huge wooden thrones with her
 face screwed up in concentration, was not looking directly at me, but I
 would be within her peripheral vision.

Siobhan, a quarter of the way around the circular wall to my right, was
 shielding Liam's eyes from Heidi's spell, and had her own tightly shut.
 I saw Maggie hiding behind one of the other thrones, protecting herself
 via more mundane means from Jane or Heidi or some combination of the two.

I went to the witch dungeon, hoping that my father at least, and David too
 for preference, were close enough to intact that I could put them back
 together and add help to the fight.
 My mother should be able to shield her mate, and shielded, he'd have a
 fighting chance against the circle, if Jane couldn't burn him and Alec
 couldn't knock him out and Heidi couldn't entrance him...
 in straight combat Santiago could hold her own against him, her skill to
 his mindreading, but if my mother could fight and shield him at the same
 time

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door into the gray, dim dungeon was already open.
 Marcus's eye was perched on top of one tidy heap.
 Tufts of David's brown hair and an isolated curl of my father's bronze
 served to identify the other two consolidated piles, which were about halfway
 to healed according to what I remembered about the timing on the care and
 feeding of captive witches.
 I saw an elbow with a few chips out of it, a foot short three toes, a complete
 lower jaw, the front half of a shoulder.
 A freshly scattered fourth person, probably the day's guard on the dungeon
 broken by insurgents on their way in, was mostly in the hallway with a
 few bits in the dungeon.
 I fell to my knees on the smooth stone, beside my father's component parts,
 and started the puzzle, moving as fast as I usefully could.

\begin_layout Standard
Knuckle to hand, that sharp piece to that section of arm, half the attempts
 I made were mistakes and wouldn't knit together when I held them flush

 That icy hemisphere was from an eye, there was most of the rest of it,
 those went under the pieces of the left orbit that I'd assembled, that
 didn't work, I didn't have the right eye socket yet, that was his knee
 and went

\begin_layout Standard
As he came together I paid more attention to broad structure than to the
 contiguity of his surface.
 The little pieces prickled my hands to handle, though there wasn't enough
 venom coating their surfaces to really do more than that.
 Once his cold hands were working and had a line of contact to his brain
 he could help with his own reassembly -- even without his eyes, he'd be
 able to look through mine -- I found the fifth finger of his right hand
 and pressed it into place.
 I fixed the corresponding wrist, filled in a gap in the arm, connected
 his neck to the base of his skull, found a large chunk from the crown of
 his head and half-flung it where it belonged.
 I pieced together his shoulder and the arm twitched in the first possibly
 purposeful motion it had made since I'd arrived.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that arm in something like working order, I focused on his spine, collectin
g vertebrae and half-guessing, half-remembering the order they belonged
 in.
 His working arm was groping awkwardly but rapidly through the pieces it
 could reach, squeezing them together at the right edges and finally shoving
 a complete pelvis against the end of the spine I'd put together.
 I started work on his other arm, making sure I had a view of everything
 he could reach so he could use my vision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When his second arm was intact except for the half-thumb Aro was wearing,
 I started picking through the tinier pieces to complete his eyes.
 I found what turned out to be the left socket, and put it in the correct
 place on his face, and looked for suspiciously rounded pieces for the eye
 itself.
 I finished the eye, put it under his brow, and started placing dry, almost
 venomless teeth into his jaw, drawing on the training of a dentist Aro
 had eaten once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He'd put his own ribcage and its contents together by the time I finished
 that, although he hadn't moved from his prone position; I busied myself
 with his left leg.
 He found part of his neck I'd missed, put it where it belonged, and, weakly,
 drew breath.
 Just the once, like he was testing his lungs, and then he stopped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After shy of six minutes, he was finished except for the stolen part he'd
 need to take off Aro and a couple of smaller bits that I thought might
 have been kicked into the hallway when the guard had been taken apart.
 I didn't know how to figure out which belonged to him, at least not quickly,
 and it was only a toe and a wedge-shaped piece of his thigh, nothing he
 would need urgently.
 He sat up, but was eerily still, and I wondered if he had the strength
 to move and fight immediately -- he would have been fed the subsequent
 week if the normal schedule had been followed, but he also wouldn't have
 needed to get up at any point.
 He took a shallow breath.

Blood,

 he mouthed, barely producing sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got up and ran to Vasanti's room.
 I didn't know what animals she had at the moment, but there would be some
 of them, and they would contain blood, albeit maybe not enough.
 Some of them would be in cages or otherwise restrained and couldn't have
 scattered during the initial assault.
 I found a mazelike network of tubing full of rats, a ten-foot terrarium-dwellin
g python, a pair of hooded hawks tied to perches, and a small dovecote with
 half a dozen pigeons in it.
 I tore a tapestry off of her wall, broke the birds' wings so they couldn't
 fly away, bundled up all the animals in the weaving without much caring
 if they got hurt in the process, and ran back to my father.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He drained the snake first, moving carefully as though afraid he'd disintegrate,
 but once he had that first mouthful of blood he visibly sped up.
 He ate everything except the last three rats, which he left scrabbling
 around in the wad of fabric, and then he tipped himself up to his feet
 and was gone in a burst of motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I sat beside David's pieces and began to solve the second puzzle.

\begin_layout Standard
David couldn't read my mind, but I sent him a stream of what I was looking
 at so he could help me once one of his arms was repaired.
 I spent what mental capacity I didn't need to seek and combine pieces,
 or share my eyes, on composing a summary of what was going on outside the
 dungeon.
 When he was together, he ate the three rats my father had left behind,
 but didn't immediately get to his feet.

 he whispered, when he could, looking at me and around at the room with
 Marcus's fragments and the few guard bits, and out into the hallway with
 more white and pale olive twitching debris.

I pushed the summary at him, and he shook his head slowly as though to clear

 I was thinking of the fight with Demetri, how I'd been able to help even
 without blasting, but I couldn't think of any truths I could throw at the
 Volturi that would so much as slow them down.
 Even deprogramming them wasn't likely to help.
 They were hemmed in by people who saw them as a group, and had little choice
 but to work together.
 They also had some non-negligible 
\emph on

He took off, towards the throne room, and I stood there in the dungeon beside
 the quivering fragments of Marcus for a moment, and then I went.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't bother to run.
 No one was getting out of the throne room until the fight was decided one
 way or the other.
 I walked briskly down the hall, intending to re-join the wolves and maybe
 get a head start on explaining everything to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I was halfway to the stairwell, someone I did not expect to see blurred
 around the corner, zipped up to me too fast for my reflexes to be of any

And he's managed to pull Jane away from Renata and fling her to the others
 to take care of, so that's the little torture device done for...
 and the same with Alec; he wasn't fast enough to anesthetize anyone before
 they took him apart...
 and your mother had to break Heidi herself, although the Romanians helped
 her some, with their eyes closed...
 Santiago got one good hit in against your father when he got too close
 to her reaching for Sulpicia.
 He probably could have taken it and been up to fight again under normal
 circumstances, but he's not in such fine shape right now in spite of your
 clever idea to feed him Vasanti's pets.
 So he's healing, slowly, while your mother tries to shield everyone else
 long enough to let them bypass Renata.
 She'd go in herself but 
\emph on
Chelsea
\emph default
 could break her, let alone Santiago, so shielding from a safe distance
 it is.
 She's not having much luck, but she'll manage it eventually, and the Volturi
 have no offensive power left.
 The intermittent shielding

\emph default
 mean Chelsea hasn't been able to get a secure enough grip on anyone's threads

Anyway, I wasn't watching the updates for my personal entertainment, I was
 doing it specifically to foil Alice.
 I made a variety of trivial but highly visible decisions based on the number
 of words in each message.
 And then, when they went unusually quiet, and the one post that did go
 up was Leah writing that she heard barking from North -- phrased to make
 it sound to the outside world like she heard her neighbor's dog making
 a fuss, of course, but I knew what she was talking about -- I risked approachin
g a little closer.

Elspeth,

This compound is in a city.
 Humans 
\emph on
live
\emph default
 in cities.
 I wasn't really 
\emph on
aiming
\emph default
 when I busted us out of here, I'm sure you remember.
 I caught about fifteen human-type people in the radius, not just most of
 the Volturi.
 And it turns out humans do not recover at all well from the experience.
 And six of them were not readily turned into prey -- intrusive family or
 too much publicity or something, I suppose.
 So the blast victims are in a hospital not far from here, babbling their
 little heads off about how beautiful Beijing was in 1142 and how ripe an
 opportunity for unrestrained feeding is presented by this Herr Hitler's
 new and exciting policies, and most of what they're saying isn't in Italian
 in the first place.
 They can't let much slip that's actually damaging -- anyone who actually
 walks into the castle at their urging can be eaten or politely thrown out
 for trespassing or Heidi can show them out or Pyotr can order them to leave
 and keep their mouths shut as many times as it takes.
 And of course it wouldn't be at all unusual for one of them to be thinking
 
\emph on
rather
\emph default
 a lot like me, so I gambled on it sounding natural enough if I hid among
 them until I was all set to dive in.
 I got the timing very neatly, apparently, although it was close.
 I climbed the wall and let myself into the dungeon, found the guard already
 dispatched for me, borrowed your father's toe, and hid out down the hall
 to listen in on what was going on.

Your mother's done it, apparently...
 I can't read anyone on your side, she's got the shield up nice and steady,
 but Renata is in just precisely the sort of pain I would expect if she'd
 been smashed up good and proper.
 Siobhan made short work of Santiago after that, and the Romanians ganged
 up on Aro and Tanya and Kate took Sulpicia.
 Chelsea's missing her hands, so she can't do anything, and now your mother's
 monologuing at her.
 I'll send you a copy of what Chelsea's thinking of that when she's done,
 if you like.

Leah tweeted the human news story about it.
 Or, well, she didn't tweet it directly, but she had enough suggestive remarks
 in her feed that I was able to find it on my own and figure out from there
 what the deal was.
 Aha, your mother's all done monologuing at Chelsea.
 Want to see? I got it via your father, so it won't be as high-fidelity
 as the memories from Aro, but it should do.

You can't create that.
